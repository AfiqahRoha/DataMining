fhh9ug,"Yes, it will shred CS:GO even on max. What the CPU number means:*  **i7:** Intel's second fastest line of consumer CPUs, after the i9 and before the i5.* **9:** The 9th-generation of i7s, also known as Coffee Lake.* **750:** Fastest chip in this line (depending on the final letter). Intel tend to go up to 750.* **H:** Fastest laptop chip, but can be power-hungry."
fhh9ug,I'd recommend staying away from dell G3 as it has terrible heating issues. I'd rather recommend the Lenovo Y540 or the Asus Zephyrus G. They are far better value than the G3
fhh9ug,1: Mobile Ryzen 4000 is too close not to wait.https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-Ryzen-4000-laptop-prices-and-release-dates-accidentally-leaked-by-Canadian-retailers.457173.0.html2: 9750H runs hot on cooling much better than the G3's.
fhh9ug,The Gpu is not on par with the cpu and the 512 ssd is bare minimum so more storage would be good
fhh9ug,Have you looked at the Acer Helios 300 same specs and better cooling than the Dell. I am using one and the specs are good for playing latest games on high and it comes with factory undervolting!Fans get noisy if they ramp up but I  use a headset so no problem.
fhh9ug,"Hey,Short answer, yes.Long answer: [**Dell Gaming G3 15 3590**](https://noteb.com/?model/model.php?conf=12226235585877000192_3259&ex=USD&ref=starchaser) is a decent gaming laptop. It's the budget-friendly version of the G5/G7 so it doesn't have the best build quality. I7-9750H is a six-core processor that combined with GTX 1660 TI Max-Q will allow you to play most AAA games in high settings. This laptop will handle whatever you will throw at it with no problems but I do recommend undervolting.What is your budget? Maybe we can find something better."
fhh9ug,Yeah it should work our week unless you plan on running super intense games like Red dead 2 and Ultra settings or something
fhh9ug,To search for laptop go to noteb.com also i7 9750h very good as well as 1660 ti
fhh9ug,"Yeah that would be a great option, but how much are you paying for it ?"
fhh9ug,"People have been saying that the Dell G3 I'm going to get is prone to overheating.Is there a laptop that has similar specs (i7 processor, gtx 1660 - gtx 1070, 16gb ram) that has better thermal control and doesn't overheat? If I'm buying a laptop I don't want it to be hot to the touch, but I also don't want it to run loud fans when I'm doing college work in class - I don't mind if the fans are on during gaming but surely they can't be that loud, right?"
fhh9ug,"Trust me, i7-9750H is one of the most powerful laptop CPUs, saying from experience. With 1660Ti, it will run CSGO, Overwatch like butter on Max Graphics.So, basicallyi7-9750H- i7 - Stronger than i5/i3 and weaker than i9. More than enough for you. - 9 - 9th Generation ( Latest for laptops) - 750 - Really really fast chip - H - laptop model Also, 6 cores so, enough for heavier games. GTX 1660TiNot the most powerful laptop GPU, but more than enough for your needs.There are better options but they tend to run loud and hot.Overall these are good specs but....... I don't really trust Dell. I have heard a lot of complains about them and their Alienware series have a lot of defective products. Don't know much about G series though. Hope this helps. Good luck, man"
fhu8dv,"You donâ€™t need as much as you think, I run a base model Surface Pro 6 (i5 8gbs), and Im in Electrical and Computer engineering. My machine works amazing for me, despite all of the processor and computer organization softwares we model and work on in school. If you want a good battery, stay away from 4K screens. Unless itâ€™s in the Surface lineup, stay away from 2in1â€™s, conventional clamshells have a higher build quality and unless itâ€™s an iPad or a Surface product, itâ€™s hard to use a 2in1 for notes and whatnot (laptop as a tablet can be cumbersome). Sometimes the Surface Book 2 has great deals, especially on Newegg. Some models, not all, have a GTX 1060, plus the screen is detachable for notes and hw, and a great battery."

It has a firm chassis which gives it a premium and robust feel to it and it is very lightweight which makes it very easy to take around. When gaming the fans get a bit loud but that is expected for small chassis laptops as the fans have to work a lot to keep it cool. Upgrading is a pain to do as the motherboard is upside down but with time you can do it.

If this is the case, I recommend the Dell XPS 15. Itâ€™s portable and sleek while still having most of your needs for $1500. If you need more ram, you can just buy and replace the memory included."

Graphically, it may be bit average, as I run some indi games and I have to lower spec a bit to make it nice. Check out the Surface Book 2 as well (some models come with a GTX 1060). Newegg has some good sales on them sometimes.In all I love my surface pro for portability and notes. I can even do my homework all electronically now, and itâ€™s a dream.

fjdn4r,If you want to have a real party: paper towel and rubbing alcohol will turn that entire box of dirty outdates cables and adapters into a box of the same things but much cleaner.
fjdn4r,"Iâ€™m pretty sure you donâ€™t need that 30 pin iPod docking station anymore.I have a JBL with that dock in the garage, thankfully mine has an aux in, so connect it to my first gen echo dot so it sounds better."
fjdn4r,Sorry I donâ€™t know what you mean. You see Iâ€™m British and our Prime Minister wonâ€™t let us quarantine ourself until all the old people are dead and everyone else has been infected.
fjdn4r,Can I buy these from you?
fjdn4r,"I share your pain with the refusal to throw out expensive apple dongles but there is a limit, you definitely donâ€™t need multiple vga to dvi, vga to coax, let alone 30 pin docks.i mean we are a few short years away from all 30pin devices being fire hazards from the aging and expanding batteries, you gonn show them off in style as they explode from charging?"
fjdn4r,Honestly I just see a bunch of obsolete crap. Chuck it.
fjdn4r,My man this is not the kind of apple a day that keeps the doctor away
fjdn4r,Marc Maronâ€™s newest stand up special is about the â€œEnd Timesâ€ and he has a bit about organizing all his extra wires and that maybe some day someoneâ€™s gonna be able to save the world with an OG Palm Pilot but they donâ€™t have the charging cable. Thought for sure this was going to be related haha. Itâ€™s on Netflix btw.
fjdn4r,Iâ€™ve yet to have a charger or set of apple headphones survive. Let alone that hoard.

fjdn4r,no iâ€™m learning music
fjdn4r,dude this is a down payment for a car
fjdn4r,Not only did I organize my cables. I organized my entire home - and redid some of it a second time. I am so bored!

fjdn4r,No...but time to clean and perhaps do laundry finally
fjdn4r,You might be hoarding a little here

fjdn4r,Nice you have some of the really old power cables like 30 pin and some for the older Macâ€™s

fjdn4r,No
fjdn4r,How much? lol
fjdn4r,Bro what are you stuck in 2010
fjdn4r,Yup. I finally got around to organizing my nuclear wasteland of a desk.
fjdn4r,... no...
fjdn4r,Those need quarantining
fjdn4r,Dongle
fjdn4r,When is the last time you have used some of these?
fjdn4r,You mock me
fjdn4r,A worthy activity to be sure.  Looks familiar.
fjdn4r,Low key a flex

fjdn4r,They are organized.

fjdn4r,they look a little sticky.
fjdn4r,Iâ€™m sorry but thatâ€™s disgusting.  Why do you keep outdated cables?
fjdn4r,Surprised your Apple headphones and charging cables lasted long enough to be put in storage

fjdn4r,Wait...they already look organized to me.
fjdn4r,"You served well, RIP"
fjdn4r,You donâ€™t have kids. Iâ€™m run off my feet.
fjdn4r,Organize? Easy. Just throw that bin int he trash and save yourself the time for something useful.
fjdn4r,That's almost enough to plug headphones in.
fjdn4r,I would have thrown all of this away.

fiila6,My MacBook Air battery died being only 3 years old because I was using it most of the time plugged in. I'd recommend you doing the heavy CPU work plugged in and on light tasks use it unplugged.

fhx29u,">I would get it looked at if they would fix the port problem for free but I'm worried once they see water damage I'm gonna have to pay like $299 and I'll say never mind, and then the trade in value goes out the window because Apple has deemed it damaged by me, the consumer.They will inspect it when you trade it in regardless, at which point they are just as likely to find water damage. You got nothing to lose."
fhx29u,"Yes, you'll have to pay $299 to repair your $1799 computer that you spilled water on.  Why you would sell it for $390 is beyond me, seems like a fun waste of $1400 bucks, but yes the trade in partners will obviously detect that you've gotten the computer wet and deny you of any value.  Apple will show you no sympathy because you bought a computer with one port, decided you wanted more ports, and then spilled water on it.  They'll fix it for $299, as is part of your AppleCare agreement, but all of this is entirely your fault."

fhhxsy,Don't buy the 2017 MBP. You'll be dealing with the keyboard issues even though it still has one year left on the repair program for it. Yeah maybe you should rent a Mac first. You need to recognize to yourself why you actually want one. Since you have a perfectly working Dell XPS and you're happy with it then I don't see the point of swapping it for something else used that runs a different OS.
fhhxsy,"If the price is irresistible then donâ€™t fight it. Number of cores makes no difference for your usage. The only caveats are the small SSD, which youâ€™re aware of, and Office. The applications are frustratingly menu-driven, with barely a keyboard shortcut to be seen."
fhhxsy,Since you already have a desktop you might consider an iPad Pro with a Smart Keyboard instead of a MacBook. This gives you access to all the iPad only apps.

If you have upgraded to Catalina you will see multiple containers, dropping back to an older OS will require a full SSD erase while booting from another source.If you have an 8GB USB 3 drive handy you can create a boot drive using the **createinstallmedia** command, Google that command and you will find instructions on how to build a bootable USB drive. After the boot drive is created you can boot via USB and fully format the internal SSD, eliminating all data in one shot. After it is erased you can install a fresh OS and sell the computer ready for a new user.If you don't have a flash drive handy you can restart the computer and hold down **command option R** (or **command shift R** on some Macs) when you press the power button and it will download and boot from the internet.

ffradx,The MacBook pro with the specs that you listed will be able to handle coding just fine. And the question whether itâ€™s worth buying or not really depends on the price and how long you want to use the laptop.
ffradx,"***"" I have a tight budget so I was looking to buy a refurbished MacBook.""***I'd like to add one more thing OP. If your Mac is not being purchased through Apple's online refurb store then you're not buying a certified refurbished Mac, but rather a repack of a return. No retailer of any type (other than Apple) sells truly certified refurbished Macs and Apple certainly has no 2015 refurbs. Also Apple's refurbs come with Apple's 1 year warranty and they have new screens, new battery, new keyboard, new speakers and new storage drive. There's no scratches on their casing because that's new also."
ffradx,"I use a 2019 MacBook Air for coding and it handles it perfectly fine, it is a tank that can easily manage a lot of what you throw at it without even revving up the fans. If you are particularly heavy with it then I recommend a standing case for it to allow air to flow underneath for better cooling."
ffradx,"The 2015 machines are great, HDMI port, deep keyboard press, and swappable memory components."
ffradx,"I use my 2015 Retina MBP for coding/Adobe CC/bit of drone footage editing and it runs flawlessly. I upgraded the SSD to a Samsung Evo 970 Plus for some added speed/storage over the stock SSD and it runs like a dream. It's a great device that has good I/O and doesn't require stupid dongles for simple things like plugging in USBs or connecting to a screen.Ignore any users here talking about it not performing in 5 years, the 4770HQ CPU is a beast and will still work with programs in five years. If Apple nerf OS updates from being compatible/if the refurb hardware lasts that long is a different question though. I'd say shop around but if you have your heart set on it go for it."
ffradx,"I was also about to ask this question. I am planning to buy a 2015 15"" MacBook Pro. I am a UX Designer. Will fit my profile?"
ffradx,I have one and I ain't planning on replacing it. It's nice having real I/O instead of a dongle collection. Intel cpus haven't exactly improved much in a long time.

The HD 3000 can't game even for light games.   Unless by light you mean solitaire and chess.  They swap to the iGPU in situations that would make it save power, or build less heat.The HD 3000 is probably equivalent to the first PCIe gen1 GPUs that came out when AGP 4x was being replaced. I think your thinking about the 2013 iMac.  Some models got nVidia, some got the Intel Iris.  The iris was over hyped.  It was a very good iGPU to come from Intel.

fctexi,Get a USB C to USB A adapter
fctexi,Yep ^^^^^You cant make the installer in windows. Needs a mac os boot volume to work.
fctexi,"You can, though Iâ€™m not sure whether this breaks EULA. Some people who hackintosh donâ€™t have Macs, so they use this software called â€œgibMacOSâ€, which creates a macOS USB bootable drive. Iâ€™m assuming that it will boot on a regular Mac too, since the installer isnâ€™t modified in the process.Edit: Link to software: https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOSJust download the recovery DMG using gibMacOS, then use MakeInstall.bat to run it if youâ€™re on Windows."
fckp6x,Twisted nematic (or TN) refers to the technology; not the capabilities.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film-transistor\_liquid-crystal\_display#Twisted\_nematic\_(TN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film-transistor_liquid-crystal_display#Twisted_nematic_(TN))
fckp6x,Since 2002 I've never known any Powerbooks or MacBook Pro's to use TN panels.
fckp6x,Well because it's TN. It would be false advertising if Apple say it's LCD. Same with any LCD display. There are good LCD that are even better than low end OLED

fcfmme,"I had an old spinner disk in one of my older MacBooks, and the machine eventually got real slow. Booting from an SSD connected via thunderbolt sped it up greatly."
fcfmme,"FWIW I have a 2012 iMac with a spinner in it. I popped in a 512GB SSD via USB 3.0 and it runs SO MUCH BETTER.I think I am getting r/w rates of around 300mbps compared to the 130mbps or so of the spinner. I think. I was so excited it was more than 2x as fast as the internal drive I just started playing with it and didn't store the numbers in my head. If you run it over TB3 I would imagine you'll get closer to the rated SSD speeds which are probably about 500+mbps or so.Caveat: I only set this up on Thursday so my experience is a little limited. It will probably be a bit slower than the internal drive you have, but my guess is that it's unlikely to be anything you really notice. Honestly, since you already have the drive, you don't have much to lose to just try it.&#x200B;edit: I think I wasn't very clear up there. I cloned my boot drive to the USB SSD and I am running it exclusively off the USB connected drive now."
fcfmme,"I donâ€™t think speed is necessarily an issue, but I do have reservations about running from an external disk since I occasionally have all of my connected disks get ejected for reasons I am unsure of (probably USB power issues). That would not be great if your system disk is ejected."
fcfmme,"I use an external SSD and speeds are 2500mb read , 2150mb write."
fcfmme,I used to run my mac mini from a 1tb wd my passport  5400 rpm hdd usb2.0 and its performance was more than  acceptable. A ssd in an usb 3.2 external enclosure  should be pretty responsive.
fc0o51,"The simplest way to accomplish what you need is to set up two user accounts. Set up yourself as an admin account. Set her up with a user account.  She can sign into her own iCloud ID. She will have her own Photos, Music, email, etc. And she will not be able to see yours.   It is possible to set up a shared directory for things you want to share. But for me, the easiest way to share stuff without worrying about permissions is to put it on an external drive. Generally, anyone can reach an external drive.  (I think bootable clones are an exception)You can set up a feature called fast user switching, so it is easy to switch from one account to another without signing all the way out.  You can switch accounts from a drop-down menu. (You still have to know the password of the account you are switching to)For apps, it is possible to place them where only you can use them, or you can place them where all users can use the app, but they have their own data. For most apps, you would want them where anybody can use them, say Microsoft Word, for example."

fbt0zs,"The kernel panic is calling out the Bitdefenfer kernel extension. Iâ€™d suggest completely removing that software using the developerâ€™s instructions and see if the panics continue. If they donâ€™t, then that kernel extension is your issue."
fbt0zs,Try this and see if it helps https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/372183/catalina-crashing-at-shutdown-with-this-error
fbt0zs,"I read through the logs, the kernel trap jumped out at me.The line relating the kernel panic report indicates the System panicked due to a Page Fault (type 14=page fault). Faults are usually indicative of an invalid read or write of an unmapped page of memory. The RIP value holds the address of the faulting instruction: 0xffffff8008a08b23 - which is consistent with both logs. the panic report contains the address of the memory that when accessed, triggered the page fault: Fault CR2: 0x0000000000000028 - you'd need a third party app like Hopper Disassembler to backtrace exactly what is causing this issue.There's likely a 3rd-party app that you have installed that is causing the page fault, an app that is loading into memory before your System completes loading. IME, Type 14 Page Faults are tied to the graphics drivers in a Mac, and it's not a new issue going back at least a few years IIRC. The offending app(s) may be accessing your GPU ""improperly"".I do not have a ready ""fix"". First, I'd reset your PRAM. Next, boot into Safe Mode and run the First Aid option in Disk Utility. And, also in Safe Mode, create a new Volume and install either Mojave or Catalina into that new Volume - and then install your apps into that new Volume one at a time and test what happens. Or, using that clean install of Mojave or Catalina you could gradually start over.If the KPs continue in the clean install of macOS, consider that your Mac has a hardware issue.There could be an app that you use that loads data into VRAM in an improper fashion. Apps like FireFox, anything from Adobe CC, Paragon NTFS drivers, anything that installs kext files, any app that uses Chromium (Chrome, Epichrome, Opera, Edge, Vivaldi, Brave) - have their own proprietary GPU calls and could be unsetting your Mac's system, making calls for hardware acceleration as an example.You have installed Catalina - be aware that there are two System and two Library folders - one for the OS and one for user data. The former is sandboxed by design - you have upgraded your Mac's OS, and there may be an offending kext file left over from the upgrade - keep that in mind and consider a reinstall of your OS.Good luck!"

fbotza,"Although it can run Catalina, there is a good chance that support will be dropped soon (the 2011 Mac mini apparently can only run up to High Sierra). Once it can no longer run the latest OS, it will still get security updates for a couple of years, and it might also be possible to use something like the dosdude1 patcher to install an OS that isn't officially supported. So there are options, and I would say you would be safe for at least 2-3 years."
fbotza,"I wouldn't be surprised if 2012 Macs don't get the next version of MacOS.   But each version gets 3 years of security patches so Catalina will be supported for 2 1/2 years still.   Referring to your other post - if you have the wherewithal to install another OS, you obviously have options to keep a 2012 Macbook secure and updated.[You could install Linux on your Mac](https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/how-install-linux-on-mac-3637265/) [There is a way to install Catalina on an out of date Mac](https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/install-catalina-old-mac-3654960/) and I am betting that this software will be used to update future obsolete Macs with newer versions of macOS.   You can also just keep running your old version of macOS.   It will still work and while there might be a long term prospect of certain Apple services, like access to the iTunes Store and Mac App Store, shutting down - you can still install al the software you need from the internet.  While you do run the risk of using a system that will have a major security flaw discovered, it isn't as if this is a guarantee.   The sky will not fall on 2012 Macs if they go to the obsolete list next year."
fbotza,"2012 Mac minis are great! I'm on one right now! With lots of RAM and an SSD, they are very capable. HOWEVER you probably won't get more than a few more years of current OS. Nobody knows, every answer is speculation, but I don't think 10.16 will drop 2012 support. But after that, any update may drop it."
fbotza,"I own a 2012 Mini Server - 2.3GHz i7, 16GB RAM (boosting the shared VRAM to 1.5GB, 512GB 850 Pro SSD/stock 1TB spinner).I'd have a hard time justifying to myself buying this Mac today if I want future proofing. I have Mojave installed, it's basically a media server and I am considering selling it and replacing it with a 2018 model.The pros: it's still supported via macOS updates and IMO will get at least one more update (it supports metal), my unit has been connected to a sine-wave UPS since Day 1 and is in a place with air filtration, and if I can't get a decent resale price, I can install Win10 on it knowing that Intel is still pushing GPU updates and still use it for a media and server server.The cons: the newer Mini is rocking a desktop-class CPU and will be supported a decade after my 2012 unit with a mobile CPU. The newer Mini has a much better iGPU and much faster PCIe storage - I would use it for rendering with Handbrake, Compressor, and Adobe CC apps more often. It matches my iMP's color. /s on the last one...I'd rather pay more for a 2018 Mini and forget that the 2012 unit even existed, this coming from an owner of a nice 2012 Mini Server..."

fbopbx,"The external drive should be in a common format both OSs can read and write. Format the drive as ExFAT, if it already has stuff on it you will need to relocate the data temporarily, format as ExFAT and then copy it back. When creating your BootCamp partition set it for around 80 to 100GB. After BootCamp is functional you can connect the drive and use it like any other Windows computer with external drive."
fbopbx,ExFAT is readable by both OSs. You shouldnâ€™t have to disconnect after changing the boot OS. As long as it is a USB3 drive it should work acceptably well for both.
fbncom,"Iâ€™d just back up your files, make an install usb of Catalina and start from scratch. The iMacs with mechanical drives always get temperamental like this if you just keep updating them over the years."
fbncom,"If you do, in fact, have a mechanical HDD, sounds like it's failing. I'd skip the internal drive at this point and create an install usb stick. Install your OS on an external SSD and boot from that. You should be able to access your internal drive and copy any data from there. Once you're up and running again, you can then try to determine the status of your internal drive."
fbncom,"I would \***NOT**\* reinstall your operating system until you know what is going on. If you have a hardware problem, that will just make it worse. What does this Mac have for a drive? Is it a hard drive? OR fusion drive? The hard drives apple uses in even new iMacs, for their hard drives and fusion drives, are SUPER slow. Absurdly slow. On top of that, Mojave is even slower on hard drive based Macs. So what you probably want to do is run a program called SMART Utility (google it) and see if it says your drive is failing.If not, then I'd check for Malware. Run MalwareBytes for Mac. The free version is perfectly sufficient. Of neither of those solves the problem, then it's time for more diagnosing."

I'd run Linux on it, so I guess picking a config that has Ubuntu preinstalled would be the safest bet since that would guarantee hardware support. However the only such config right now comes with touchscreen and I'd prefer one without it, and all of those come with Windows.Should I wait for more options or can I just pull the trigger on a Windows build and install Linux on it? I don't see any difference in hardware on the store (sans the Ubuntu version losing the fingerprint reader since they don't support it on Linux) so I guess that would mean it would run Arch without any hiccups, or are there any more differences under the hood?"

All you've linked is an image of the laptop. Is there an article somewhere?"

fd2ecn,"beautiful machine, has basically the only port I want (SD). Problem is availability and price. I look at the machine and think, ""damn I want one"". Then I go to the price and the only model in Canada that has 16GB (and configurations are HORRIBLE) is almost as expensive as a refurbished MBP16, which trounces this machine. The **i3**, **4GB** model is like $1350 in Canada. Ridiculous.I'd sooner get an upcoming mbp and get the $200 ram addon for much cheaper."

I was able to get the i7, 8gb ram, 512gb SSD and standard screen for $1,248 after a 17% discount from their current sale. I must say that to upgrade to 16gb of ram they wanted +$100 which isn't as bad as apple (I think) but still overpriced. I hope someone finds this helpful, I'm in the US so no Idea if this applies to those of you in Canada."

fawg69,"So I just need to wait a couple more months then I might get a working laptop...7 month old G7 that's been in dell warranty repair for 2+ months, mailed in 4 times.  Two mobo replacements, and now full case replacement due to the damage the service center did to my laptop."
faxc99,Would they do that with a motherboard?  I wonder.  I had to have mine replaced twice... then when I got the laptop back it was damaged.  Now its back in the service depot getting the case repaired.
faxc99,"Dell's support, especially CompleteCare has gone down the toilet in the past decade.Fortunately Dell laptops cost half as much as they used to, so you can buy 2 and keep one on standby."
fabrgk,"X1 extreme and XPS 15 / Precision 55x0 are similar stories: 45W CPU with a considerable GPU packed in a case too thin to cool them properly at combined heavy load (gaming or CPU+GPU intensive deep learning or such), even i9 alone is overkill with these heatpipes and fins. XPS 15 should get a refresh in April, if you care for it."
fabrgk,P1 gen 2 will be expensive ðŸ¥´
fabrgk,Worst decision youâ€™ve made. Iâ€™ve switched fro Lenovo to dell and I wish I never had... 1.Customer support is garbage 2.driver support is also garbage along with the bloatware that dell includes with their drivers3.their machines donâ€™t and canâ€™t compare to the think-pad line of products
fa3e9c,"Remember: just because your charger can PUT OUT more wattage (volts multiplied by amps) doesn't mean your device will USE it (or in the case of USB-C, negotiate for it). The only real way to tell what's being delivered is to put an in-line USB-C power meter on it (I have one for when I was testing sleep/resume code in the Linux kernel, it was $15 at Amazon).But, that's unrelated to what's probably the real issue here, where Dell detects their own chargers and puts out messages for non-Dell ones. My 7390 2-in-1 doesn't do this, thankfully."
fa3e9c,Where did you get this charger?  Iâ€™m interested in buying one that powerful.
fa3e9c,"My impression is that the funny business going on with Dell is more like few particular power levels accepted and unreliable PD negotiation. With XPS 15 for instance it is known that in most cases 60W @ 20V 3A get accepted (but some with a few such chargers the negotiation fails), while 45W @ 20V 2.25A gets accepted only from Dell and one 3rd-party while most others fail. Recent models tend to take 65W, but I don't recall anything higher reported accepted except for the Dell original 130W chargers that are above standard (100W max). I've noticed a ""PD controller"" being updated during one firmware update. Indeed it would be nice if Dell took care of this, now that 100W PD chargers and powerbanks are becoming more widely available. With Dell round plug chargers that provide one-way power level identification, the laptops can accept different power levels available (45W, 60W, 90W, 130W...) Try contacting the charger manufacturer if they can debug this."
fa3e9c,"From my limited research into docks for my xps 15 recently, it seems like the USBC 130W dock can do 130W over USB for Dell laptops, others would be at 90W.  So it's probably a Dell thing."
fa3e9c,"Make sure the Type C to Type C cable you are using is capable of 5 Amps.  It has to be an 'active' cable for that, the passive ones top out at 3 Amps, which only gives you 60W charging at 20V. This might be the reason your Latitude is complaining.  If you have a Thunderbolt 3 cable, try that one. Those must be active and therefore capable of 5 Amps."
f9p1wy,"90% sure it's static electricity from your socks or something. Been near any wool lately? Did you wear rubber-soled shoes, maybe?"
f9p1wy,"As stated above, it could be a couple of different things: either static electricity or a bad outlet.If you have a bad outlet (or even a bad surge protector) then it's possible that the AC adapter to your laptop isn't grounding (earth) properly.  Laptops actually run on DC current that is converted from house AC current.  (fun fact: That brick / box in the middle of your power cord is actually an electrical transformer that is where the magic happens to ""transform"" AC to DC.). Because the laptop actually runs on DC, there's no reverse current to dissipate voltage buildup - kinda like overflowing a cup with water - the voltage has no where to go.  This voltage buildup is typically dissipated to ground/earth from the transformer and is a natural, normal thing in electronics.  However, if you don't have a good ground, then your body becomes the ground when you touch your laptop - which releases the built up voltage that you experience as a shock.  Too much voltage buildup is really really hard on your laptop and you should immediately check for a bad ground.On the other side, it is possible it's just static electricity.  Unsure of where you are located, but if you're in the US, there's a large snow storm for much of the country yesterday.  Hot temperatures with low humidity (like a heater running) plus socks (cause it's friggin COLD outside) can encourage and emphasize static buildup just like the AC adapter.... You walk around, generate a voltage buildup, touch the laptop (which is grounded) and zap - voltage dissipated.Quick test - plug your laptop into a wall outlet (with a new surge protector) in a room with tile / wood floor (no carpet) and bare feet.  Turn it on see if it zaps you.  If it does, it's a bad ground in your house and you need an electrician to check it out.  If it doesn't, it's probably static electricity and not a big deal; maybe consider a grounding mat from Amazon or just be more aware of how static electricity is formed so you can avoid it.Tangent : voltage buildup in a laptop is typically caused from the cooling fans running - turning magnet in an electrical field generates an electrical current.  It's very normal and is typically low enough to dissipate into the chassis and grounded out.  A major shock and/or a frequent shock is probably not the fans though."
f9p1wy,Might be something wrong with your outlets and not the laptop.
f9p1wy,Most likely static. But can also be an issue with the AC adaptor(s?) or the power outlet. Not the laptop.
f9p1wy,"sigh... its static electricity, nothing new since the dawn of  carpet, socks and other clothing."
f9p1wy,"its the earthing issue it happened to me too on my g7 , check your power board"
f9p1wy,You can get an electric shock off tap water if you have a static build-up in your body. Just because you got a shock from touching your laptop doesn't mean there is anything wrong with it.
f9p1wy,"Dell support doesn't provide any form of help, it's against policy.  Just like the repair department doesn't actually do any repairs.  All they do is charge money for services they will never even consider performing."
f9p1wy,"Sounds like a static shock, as the laptop has no more than 12v going through it.Make note what peripherals you had plugged in as I get static shocks off when I have USB to serial adapters plugged into my precision."
f9x9hb,"Take the back off and see if the WiFi card is installed properly, if it is try looking for a new one."
f9x9hb,Then try looking for a new one
f9jm8w,Yes you can. You can even put a touch panel in. It is by far my favorite upgrade for this series of laptops.
f9jm8w,Yes you can. I used this one and it worked really well. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S775VZH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

f7v4zc,What's with the upside down case layout and why did that become standard?  My desktop PC is case from ~2005. Back then I noticed hot air at the top and drilled an 80mm fan hole at the top. This inverted format doesn't seem sensible to me.
f7v4zc,Lol i remember doing this to my older comp when playing diablo 2 so thaty comp wouldnt freeze.  Cpus and cases have come a long way.  I can play on my i5 for hours on the stock cooler without it even breaking 65 degrees now.

Behind that, I have a 140mm noctua fan thats just gorilla taped to the actual 5inch drive cage and it acts as my front intake now, lol.

f7jp4u,Yes -- do \*not\* get the one with 4GB of RAM. It is widely considered an insufficient amount for most purposes these days. 8GB should be fine.
f7jp4u,Why do they even sell XPS-laptops with 4GB of RAM? :mutters:
f7jp4u,+1 for 8Gigs
f7jp4u,"It depends on what you will do with your dell. If you need it just to browse and type then 4GB could be just enough considering the saving. But for 300$ you can get a better laptop that can be used for much more purposes, bacause nowdays 8GB of ram is like a base spec.(Consider also that browsers like chrome occupy a good amount of ram)"

f6ywd8,I have been refreshing the Dell's XPS 9300 listing every day to see if the 32GB version is available. I am due for a hardware refresh at work and my current XPS is starting to feel slow. I can't wait until it comes out.
f6ywd8,"I have no doubt it will come, I am just worried that with Corona virus, all things will take longer. Lots of factories in China closed and supply chain is partly paralyzed."
f6ywd8,I did the live chat with Dell and they said 32GB models would appear this week ðŸ¤ž
f6ywd8,Where do you see the regular 32 gb option? I only see 16 gb with Windows. ðŸ˜•I am also very very interested into the 9300 with something like Fedora!
f6ywd8,"I have the money in-hand and am waiting for the 16 gig with high-dpi screen option, which also isn't available yet..."
f6ywd8,Wish Dell would give an official timing update ...
f6ywd8,These have been available for the past week or week and half
f6rfej,Same with my 7590. Fans kicks off when I connect my external monitor with USB-C. Doesn't happen if I connect monitor over HDMI.
f6rfej,Check the temp of the computer above the USB C port. If it is really hot you may have a bad port. I have had the issue on several of my work computers. Dell replaced the motherboar that fixed the problem for now... I am currently fighting with Dell support on my personal 9570 about this same issue.
f6rfej,"Reinstall thunderbolt , usb 3.1 drivers, or fresh os"
f6rfej,"It might be happening because the hub is trying to charge your laptop. The charging process generates a lot of heat, so the fan has to turn on."
f6rfej,Might be fans kicking on in anticipation of controllers heating up? Hard to say.

But I have this problem near a year ago on the PC with i7 and 1060/6, after I have removed the game, because there is no solution. Somehow I think it eats recourses if they are higher than recommended or if they are not AMD or Radeon (I am not sure).Also there is zero replay in steam, will be appreciated if you find the solution.P.s. something with textures and how they load"
f63bsl,For starters uninstall KB4524244 and see how that goes refer to:[https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4524244/security-update-for-windows-10-february-11-2020](https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4524244/security-update-for-windows-10-february-11-2020)
f5t59z,"Its hard to say without knowing how you're measuring it, but it is likely because of the way that Windows (and all modern operating systems) use RAM.  Individual programs on the PC can request RAM and they'll be given it, but program memory use in total doesn't often need all of the available memory.  If the OS were to leave the remaining RAM ""empty"" then it would be wasted (i.e. at best doing nothing, at worst consuming power and not improving performance).  So Windows will fill the RAM with something useful (normally a cache of contents of your harddrive whenever its read; the page cache - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page\_cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache)).  Any RAM used in this way can be pretty much instantly freed should a program need it.This means that working out how much RAM is available is a more complex process than might be thought.  There are various figures that all mean slightly different things.  ""commit charge"" - how much address space is accounted for (not quite the same as RAM) ""available"" - could mean varous things e.g unused RAM + cached data""in use"" - physical RAM in use).In short, be sure of what you're adding up and try not to worry about it as long as you aren't having performance problems or low memory errors :)"
f5t59z,"Hey your G7 lasted over a year... GRATZ!!!  you made it bro.  Just kidding, mine lasted 5 months and has spent the last two months being ""repaired"" by Dell.You could look into 3rd party warranties, service.  Often they're much better than dealing with Dells customer support which is a nightmare for the regular consumer.   They might be able to tell if you have a hardware issue, or if its just software settings."
f5t59z,"Okay so, after half a month of poking and prodding at this, I finally have an answer that I figured I'd share. I warn you in advance, you'll want to strangle someone at Dell by the time you finish reading this, though.So: This is the what is happening. What is, in fact, happening with EVERY G7, whether the user of the laptop has realized it yet or not. And the reason is STAGGERINGLY stupid.  Turns out that the dipshit who designed this 'gaming laptop' used a hybrid graphics card setup. It has an independent Geforce Card all right, and it can PROCESS on that card, but all graphics output eventually filters through the onboard intel intergraded graphics card before being output to a screen(either a monitor or the laptop's screen, either one). This means you can't turn the integrated graphics card off...which means that said integrated graphics card pre-claims most of the system Ram for it's own use...even if it never actually gets used, since all graphics processing is handled by the Geforce card.   Mad yet? It gets worse, in a way, since this means that Dell functionally lied through their teeth in their advertising of the laptop. Not just in spirit, since it DOESN'T functionally have 16gb of usable RAM. That, at least, they could wave away with fine print, since the system technically has the RAM physically present. The one that was an outright lie, however, was that the system shipped 'Oculus Ready.' That, at the time of my purchase, would have been the Oculus Rift, as the Quest wasn't out yet. The Oculus Rift, however, requires **8 gb** of available system RAM as a minimum requirement. And it is, if you're following along, *physically impossible* for the G7 7588 (my model) to have that much memory free as-shipped...  \>\_<. At this point, to say that I will never buy a Dell computer again is an understatement. More like I will actively encourage any and all (including my own I.T. small business clients) not to do business with them."
f5t59z,"Same problem here, you will also run into thermal issues in the future."
f5nmfx,"The roadmap said around april/may, but it looks like that the Corona virus will bring a delay of a few months. So what u/Combonary said, july/august, looks like a good guess."
f5nmfx,Only dell knows right now. We can only give rough estimates of July-August
f5krlq,"They are pretty close, do I think it comes down to personal preferenceCPU same performance almost, GPU better a little bit on xps, Display MacBook, Battery MacBook, price XPS, But I think the os will decide.

f5krlq,"Great write up! I recently got the xps 15 with OLED display, and despite some issues, found I can't live with anything less, well, perhaps a the retina display.Tonight's project was upgrading the 500GB SK Hynix PC601 PCIe SSD with a 1TB Samsung EVO 970 Plus, doing a clean Win10 install. Benchmarks for the stock SSD were better than your numbers, but the Samsung numbers were a little disappointing at only 5-10% faster, with higher random IOPS and faster response times via real world CrystalMark test."
f5krlq,Great post. Thank so much.Did you compare the fan noise when the laptops are running heavy works?
f5krlq,"Also  a few things to consider, the new xps can be configured with a UHD+ screen if I am not mistaken. Also with the lower wattage newer generation i7 you get more power efficiency as well as WiFi 6.

f5ionq,"Using an ultrabook for development was a bit of a concern when they first came out - here we are almost 10 years later, and they have come a long way.Generally I find that desktops will give best perf, using say 85W or whatever CPU's, then a few years later the 45w CPU's typically found in 15"" laptops match that perf, then a few years later then 15w CPU's found in ultrabooks catch up (and I imagine the 5-7w parts a few years after that). Of course the advancements in storage and RAM help too.More concretely, I briefly tried the new XPS 13 2-in-1 as well as a lenovo C940, and now I'm on a Surface Pro 7. They've all been using the same 10th gen i7 cpu (and similar specced ram). I can run my webdev stuff just fine (several VS code windows, a nodejs server running, a webpack/create-react-app frontend, db server, redis, etc etc). It all performs just fine, and each machine this was the case. The perf is ever so slightly faster than my 2016 MBP, which in turn is ever so slightly faster than my 2014 desktop. Just make sure you get 16GB of ram. I find that my dev setup takes around 9 GB of RAM, which does mean a lot of paging and random slowdowns when running on an 8 GB machine (such as my SP6.. part of the reason I wanted to upgrade).I ended up going w/ the SP 7 because I found out my work will be upgrading my MBP, I like the idea of the small-ish tablet form factor (that I can still do dev on) as a companion to the larger 16"" device. I liked the xps as well, the screen was gorgeous, though the thermals were not amazing and for me I didn't like the feel of the keyboard, it was too much like my MBP. Also the layout w/ dedicated page up and down buttons over the left and right arrow keys and having to use a FN key for home/insert was the nail in the coffin; most devices I've been using over the past 10 years use FN+arrow keys for pg up/down and home/insert, and I kept accidentally hitting the page/up down buttons when trying to use the left and right arrow keys. These things could likely be gotten used to though, and as long as you know what you're getting yourself into with that it's a fine machine perf wise."

f50qvq,"Crazy question, is it actually enabled in the BIOS? ""TPM On"".You can also try the command in Run ""tpm.msc"" to prep the TPM if it is there, on and detected. TPM can be a pain to deal with. Dell seems to be OK but Lenovo can be worse."

f50qvq,What it is?
f50qvq,"Just randomly had this same error/problem start yesterday. This morning, I updated the BIOS on my Dell XPS 15 to 1.15.0. Then, I shut the laptop down, unplugged the power, press and hold Ctrl + Esc, and plug adapter back in while holding those keys. That performs some sort of BIOS or CMOS reset. I also selected to reset to BIOS defaults on the screen that appears. After doing all that, Windows recognized my TPM again, and Bitlocker works."

Do let us know if you have reached out to our technical support teams regarding this issue yet.If not, do get back to us with the service tag of the computer along with the registered owner's name over a private message so that we can assist you better. ^SA"
f5966i,"I have the same issue with my 2in1. Done all the updates by dell support now seeing if this fixes it. Except mine only does it on battery.I think it needs a bios update as the issue is rather random, can be fine for weeks then just shuts off."
fjx38i,I had a similar issue... For some reason resetting the router fixed it. I don't know how but yeah. Try that.
fjx38i,Did you recently get a vpn?
fjx38i,Try resetting your network settings maybe..?
fjx38i,Same happened to me yesterdayRouter turning on and off for no reason same for mouseUninstalled the drivers and restarted.I have a desktop tho
fjx38i,Go update the drivers.  Even if they're up to date just download newest. Not worked for ne

fah8mb,"Take a deep breath, not one thing you wrote makes sense. Are you having a problem with Aura Sync or Armory Crate? I have used both and have had very few issues with either.I see from time to time someone has an issue but other than one buggy release I have not seen masses of issues. Write something  coherent  about what problem you are having and specify which software you have installed.Your mobo and bios release installed will also help."
f9lu2p,"Consult the manual always. If you have 2, M.2 slots it will matter witch is populated. It did for some reason on my Crosshair 7 when I only had 1 M.2. Also when you use an M.2 you give up a certain amount of sata ports so that may be your other problem."
f9lu2p,Take out second drive.boot and install windows on main drive. Power down and reinstall second drive
f9lu2p,"Also check if you have UEFI enabled, maybe your drives are CSM.  Also at what clockspeeds are you running 1.4v seems high to me."

f7ypsw,"Clearly youâ€™ve had a bad experience with them, which is unfortunate. I have had very good experiences, including even a few times when they didnâ€™t even charge for an out of warranty repair. And I think I recall having a fairly bad experience too. Point is, donâ€™t write off the entire gamut of their products based on one bad experience."
f7ypsw,I only buy asus because I never break them and when I do best buy will fix it.
f7ypsw,"Iâ€™ve had a nightmare of an experience for the past 2 months with asus. I bought a pg35vq in October. I updated the firmware the beginning of January to fix the flickering issues that was prevalent with this monitor. Of course it bricks and I send it back to asus for an RMA. They send it back to me with a nice crack on the upper fight corner. You could blame fed ex or what we for the shipping but whatever. Now I finally got back my monitor again and for the 2nd RMA and now itâ€™s even more damaged. Not only is the same spot cracked, the bezel is also broken and now the left side is also smashed. I understand the box was in terrible shape but Jesus when I pulled out the Monitor and I saw only 2 sheets of bubble wrap on the bottom, I knew it. My once perfect $2500 monitor was now a 2500 dollar door stop. Called them up and theyâ€™ll get back to me in 24-48 hours. Iâ€™m literally done with this. Iâ€™m making 2 demands this time, refund me or send me a damn new one. Itâ€™s costing too much damn time and money to play this game."
f7ypsw,"I will have to correct you on this one. Everytime Iâ€™ve contacted customer support, I have received a anwser the next day with clear information and what I have to do.Yes, a disadvantage of ASUS products are faulty drivers, that you have to update and download and install and uninstall and so on, which are a pain in the a**. But otherwise, their products are really good. If you had a bad experience with them that doesnâ€™t mean everyone will have."
f7nvw7,Try a bios update if there is one available.
f7nvw7,"Are you have it enabled in bios? Because same shit happend to me, when I was trying to turn off the stupid rainbow shit. And don't reinstall the Windows, I used one which was previously used on my intel platform and worked great. I wanted to do fresh install, but since it worked without an issue, so why bother. And yes I use it for a lot of advance programming and shit like that, if there would be some issue, I would know about it. But drivers works differently than with Windows Vista, so get up with times.And well to be honest, my old board did not have any stupid ""RGB shit"" if that counts, but it was also Asus."

f44w3j,"Just get your card back and replace the fans yourself, they are like 30 dollars on eBay."
f44w3j,"Legally you're entitled to a 100% refund with no restocking admin or postage fees, as they've admitted liability AND that they cannot replace your product for a product which is still manufactured.Get a refund, buy a different make of 2070 super."
f44w3j,"On my 5th RMA for my Strix RTX 2070 and they decided to replace it with a new in box unit, only to have them email me yesterday about it and tell me they'd replace it with a 2080 Super. So assuming they'd give me a BRAND NEW 2080 super, I double checked and of course they said it's a recertified one.I did a little bit of research beforehand and got the representative to admit that the replacement parts they send back are units that have failed and been ""repaired"" so that would also explain why their RMA process normally isn't over after the customer's first time.Finally got tired of their bullshit so I got an MSI 2070 Super and have had 0 problems with anything at all unless it's an issue with the specific game or coil whine (possibly due to my PSU) which is honestly the least of my worries as of now.Moral of the story is that yes, Asus makes some great products and I give it to them for being one of the best brands up until recently as it seems, but just pray that you don't need to send anything in for repairs because it's been an absolute nightmare for me and others."
f44w3j,"Update: They finally got back to me and offered me a 2080, I accepted. Hopefully all goes well. I'll post another update when I receive the card and test it."

ewbz83,"I ordered the VG27AQ and then canceled it as soon as I heard this news. I've been checking pretty much every day for release date info. The new stand, higher beak brightness of at least 400 nits (VG27AQ has \~350 nits), and the smaller bezels convinced me to wait. Also, I'm hoping with this new model that they fix the pixel overshoot, response time, and ELMB sync issues that occur when running games below 100 hertz ([TFT Central](https://www.tftcentral.co.uk/reviews/asus_tuf_gaming_vg27aq.htm))."
ewf16q,"I'd be a bit surprised if there is a fundamental CPU issue if you can boot into the bios.

ewf16q,"I had a somewhat similar issue when I swapped in a R5 3600 into my X470 Prime Pro. No matter how many times I tried to enable XMP for my RAM, I got black screens and boot loops. I cleared CMOS till I was blue in the face. Eventually I needed to update the BIOS to the latest AGESA and the latest chipset drivers. Solved all my problems."
eweoai,Why not just buy yourself a pci/e USB 3 card? Might come out cheaper in the end.  or even at that get a new Mobo?  I don't think anyone has a clue as to how much they would charge.
eweoai,"Bruh... that board launched in 2014. If it has bent pins itâ€™s obviously your fault. Them charging that much for repair is 100% normal and a practice all manufactures follow. If you want it fixed go to a computer shop and see if they will fix it. Your mad at normal procedures just means your not educated in what normal is. Buying a brand new board for the same cost or less then repairing it and having warranty again is a far better option. Not to mention thatâ€™s 6 year old tech which is antique in the tech world, time to upgrade. For example you can buy a new Mobo and CPU of this current generation for around $200 that would not only outperform what you currently have but is cheaper then said repair. Now if you want it fixed for free... good luck this is the real world. Asus has a 3 year warranty I believe and thatâ€™s if it defective not you breaking it."
eweoai,"Nothing to see here.User breaks part. User blames Asus for being too expensive to repair 6 year old board.Listen to others and get a usb3 pcie card, get a replacement board, or ask a local electronics shop to replace the part for you at about the same price.If you say that you should only have to pay for the part and not the work, then you are part of the problem.  Dont come here trying to join the choir that Asus support sucks. Yes, they do, but this one is on you bro/sis."
eweoai,"Well. I understand your pain. First, in your case it's specifically a ""non-warranty"" issue, so they don't have to repair it for you. For that matter, they can ask anything for that repair.  From what I can think of you can do:1. Repair it yourself, if you can. It's not extremely difficult if you can handle solder.2. Get it repaired from any local shop, shouldn't cost much.3. Buy an additional PCI-E card as everyone has been pointing to.4. Buy, a used motherboard (this might be really cheap at times)Having said all that, my MacBook is in service for logic board repair (third time around) so even though they give service, the product quality sucks. Sometimes, it's the company, sometimes bad luck sucks :("

etv3kp,"This is a huge relief for me personally, because it means that the controller chip design is not inherently flawed. That would have been a far bigger problem."
etv3kp,Excerpts from the link:  * The failures do not steam from a defective controller chip design or overheating. **They occur because one of the firmware updates released last years was flawed**. This firmware version irreversibly damages the **SPI-ROM of the Thunderbolt controller over time**. * This also explains why the issue is a recent phenomenon: Affected older systems like the Lenovo ThinkPad T470 or T480 ran fine for years. The issues began when the flawed Intel firmware update was released last year.* The reason why some ThinkPads with Thunderbolt controllers like the X1 Extreme or ThinkPad P1 are not affected is that they use a different firmware and never were exposed to the flawed version.
etv3kp,I love notebookcheck and how it keeps on top of these things.
etv3kp,"If this erroneous firmware was Lenovo's fault, they should cover out-of warranty repairs. That's only fair."
etv3kp,"Thanks for the follow up. A couple of remarks:**1) Lenovo will DO NOTHING if your machine is out of warranty** ([I know because I tried](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/es5vt4/be_very_careful_if_you_consider_buying_a_new_or/))2) It would have been helpful **if Lenovo had stated upfront how bad the problem is**: instead of speaking of a ""critical firmware update"" it would have helped to say ""you risk damaging your hardware if you don't upgrade"".Case in point: I don't have any thunderbolt peripherals, so my thunderbolt was disabled in bios. Of course, the firmware did not apply. Had I known that the chip that is responsible for Thunderbolt, USB-C and Power delivery was physically being damaged, it would have been another story.And the breakage happened AFTER my warranty expires - so this is how I know about point 1)"
etv3kp,"My friends T480 has thunderbolt BIOS assist moe is disabled in BIOS. Does it need to be enabled to update the firmware?I checked my friend's new T480 ( his first thinkpad). Thunderbolt controller generation is 15BF.The update was done using vantage, which showed only the thunderbolt controller update and no firmware updates.Before the update, the NVM firmware version was 20.0 and controller driver version was 1.41.645.0.After the update controller version is 17.4.80.94. We could not find the NVM firmware version on the thunderbolt software ""about"" page after the update.I'm wondering if we need to do anything else. Can you please offer your comments? It would be great if we sticky this issue on the top so newcomers can spot and fix this issue."
etv3kp,So if I have made all the updates available today can I go back to Linux and be okay?
etv3kp,"How does one quantify the usage leading to wear of that chip? Is it the time the system has been on? Or the time that any thunderbolt 3 port was used for charging, usb c and other thunderbolt accessories? What about charging via a non usb thunderbolt 3 port like my x390 it only has one thuderbolt 3 port that I never used for charging. Would this count as use too?"
etv3kp,"I called Lenovo support. The support specialist are ignorant of this known problem (Defect). Lenovo is not taking this issue seriously. I am very technical, and able to fix/updates/repair.  However I tired to download the firmware updates and fix it. My laptop (Thinkpad Yoga X1 gen 2), does not detect the power supply in the first place due to the bad thunderbolt firmware. In order to fix this I need to update the firmware. However, all lenovo laptops firmware updates first checks if the laptop is connected to firmware and then goes on to update the firmware if it detects it is connected to power supply.  The problem is that lenovo support is asking me to pay to fix the problem because I am out of warranty ?.Why should I pay to fix for a faulty product they sold me.?  How many of you have this problem? I am planning to file a complaint to FTC and launch a class action lawsuit. I am wondering how these technology products companies are getting away selling faulty products to consumers and not taking ownership/responsibility of the defective products they are selling?. What about non-technical people who are not able to or unaware of these problems ?  We have the power to take make these corporations pay for this...!! Lets get to it."
etv3kp,"> There is one additional question we had: What happens with customers that have this issue with out of warranty machines? Unfortunately, Lenovo did not give us an answer about this question till now.And the answer is...?"
etv3kp,Didnt do any update I dont have windows can i update through linux ?
etv3kp,[deleted]
etv3kp,"My manager and I knew about this over a year ago, but Lenovo basically blew us off at every turn. Our issue was when the battery of a laptop would reach 100% while charging on the dock, the dock connection would completely cut out(losing monitors, peripherals, ethernet, etc) and you might have to restart if it doesn't come back after a few seconds. Our solution at the time was to return all of the TBT3 docks and switch over to USB-C docks. Switching to USB-C docks seemed to resolve most issues at the time, but now again I am seeing issues with new models and usb-c docks, which makes sense since it's related to the laptop firmware not the docks. Trying my hardest to get our corporate to let us go back to Dell...."
etv3kp,Do we know which firmware version specifically caused the issue? I have a T490 on Linux so Iâ€™m not sure if I can update the Thunderbolt firmware via `fwupdmgr`My T490 is currently at version 18 of the firmware.
etv3kp,I'm getting a failure to install the latest firmware for Thunderbolt.  Didn't notice until seeing this issue.  Anything I can try before contacting support?
etv3kp,Any way to verify if the firmware has properly updated?
etv3kp,"Hi, Iâ€™m confused. I ordered a t480s from Lenovo today. Should I be worried, or consider cancelling it?"
etv3kp,Thinkpad P1 has PLENTY of Thunderbolt issues with Thunderbolt Workstation 3 - that has still not been solved. The TBW3 is a terrible dock design.
etv3kp,"Take everything with a grain of salt and remember the recent (for example) P52 bricking adventures if for some bizarre reason you want to trust Lenovo. There's enough money riding on NOT acknowledging problems to dither until most machines are out of warranty!  Megacorps are not your friends and don't care if you live or die. They exist to get your money, end of story.Fortunately I bought my P52 before the (supposedly) bad update and immediately installed Xubuntu on a new drive while keeping the junk spinner (which I ordered to get the caddy and cable for future SSD installation in that slot) with the stock W10 install in case I need to RMA the machine.  I don't trust updates so I don't install them until the Thinkpad community confirms they aren't immediately harmful. The best reason to buy Thinkpads is other Padders, NOT the Thinkpads themselves since the original quality we know and love is many years gone and never coming back. Kudos to notebookcheck for their good work."
etv3kp,Good thing for lenovo to suck it up take the criticism. Unlike that other fruit company.....
etv3kp,I just realised that my first T480 failed last year because of this - it said it was charging but it wasn't. That was in October. Why did it take Lenovo so long to realise that something was wrong when they got a mass of service requests?
etv3kp,Does any body report this problem when your thinkpad is out of warranty?
etv3kp,Is the fixed firmware only through Lenovo Vantage or would the right firmware also be installed when downloading the driver manually from the Lenovo website?
etv3kp,"I'm using linux (Arch), on an X395 and don't have Lenovo Vantage installed. Does anyone know if this has already been updated, or if I need to do something?"
etv3kp,"Well, after updating firmware, my usb C to hdmi hub stopped working. But usb C to VGA still works.Hope that was a problem with the hub only."
etv3kp,Does anyone recall exactly when in November the fix was released.  I received a X390 end of October / Early November and would have installed the patch within days of it releasing.  Hope mine will be ok.  Otherwise love the x390.
etv3kp,"I called official Lenovo service provider in my country asking what to do with my friend's t480.They said I should try to update fw, if it gets bricked, they will do the repair as it's under warranty. Still a non necessary hassle.This is Lenovo's principle of uncertainty. The chip is in an unknown state."
etv3kp,"Got my X1 6th gen motherboard replaced under warranty after four different Lenovo dongles and docks stopped working completely. Got back the ThinkPad today and not one of the docks started working again. Working on getting the third replacement of my GEN 2 USB C, looks like it bricked all of them before my firmware was updated."
etv3kp,Anyone knows if this is related to this problem I'm having:  Usb C dock(including but not limited to the Lenovo USB C dock) disconnecting the USB devices/screens when fully charged and connecting back again every 3 to 5 min. This gets fixed if I connect via the Power adapter (non USB). Pd.

etv3kp,"For the linux users, there's still no Thunderbolt firmware update for T480 on lvfs. It's strange since they released the update for T480s a long time ago."
etv3kp,"T470 (20HDS08J00) user here, no thunderbolt firmware  (mine is currently on version \`04.00\`) on lvfs, furthermore, \`gnome-firmware\` states that the thunderbolt controller is not supported on lvfs depsite the UEFI and other system firmwares being supported.It appears Lenovo only cares about Windows users for the T470 (seems like T480 as well) since the update is only available as a \`.exe\` on lenovo's support page, it \*might\* be possible to extract the firmware from the \`.exe\` file, I have not investigated further than this.Option B is to boot to windows to update the firmware using the \`.exe\` shame....edit: booted windows 10 ToGo USB created with RUFUS (darn slow) and installed the update, it looks like the firmware file might be extractable from the exe by running it with wine and selecting ""extract only"", anyways, I am now at version 20.00"
etv3kp,"I got another update just pushed to me yesterday involving the thunderbolt driver/controller.  I've been checking every day, and apparently this update was released by mid February.  If I'm just now getting this 'fix', Lenovo can plan to replace my X390."

etv3kp,I think my next laptop and dock will be the surface laptop. I almost got one this last go around when I bought the T480.
fjs2yp,Man you're really not messing around with this quarantine stuff
fjs2yp,Thinkpads: the only laptop awesome enough to go to space!also while i love my life i think id trade it for yours
fjs2yp,"Reminds me, I've been hunting for one of the Thinkpad models that were used in the Shuttle or ISS programs just for collector's sake. Thanks for the reminder to double check eBay!"
fjs2yp,Wow!!
fjs2yp,"""**pic i took last night""** are you on the iss?"
fjs2yp,Wow
fjs2yp,Was that taken in space or on board a replica space ship/station?
fjs2yp,That picture makes me want to go into space. It looks like something out of a movie.
fj2iih,Which one?
fj2iih,Loving it
fj2iih,How long did it take for yourâ€™s to ship? I ordered a custom T495 and Iâ€™m still waiting
fj2iih,Are we upvoting any lowest quality picture now?
fj2iih,Good. Now put some stickers on it.
fj2iih,That touchpad looks strange hhh
fj2iih,HOT
fiv649,"An old sticker I hope? If not, I was going to joke about it being a jizz stain that they tried to bleach clean. Maybe just buy a new palm rest?"
fiv649,For sticker residue I normally use 100% alcohol.
fiv649,WD-40 does do a good job but you will not completely remove it unfortunately
fiw3rh,Yep been considering a used Thinkpad even tho have a Surface Pro 6. As Thinkpad can do linux on it. The Surface Pro not so much.Only downside I noticed with a lot of older thinkpad models is hit or miss on decent screens. Most being TN screens. On Sub $400 used thinkpads only found the T450s with FHD IPS panel that gives good sRGB of 95%+ and Adobe RGB in the high 70's or 80's? Have to pass the $400 mark to start seeing newer used models with IPS higher resolution screens.As a photographer and need my acceptable sRGB and Adobe RGB gamut.
fiw3rh,Which T series? All my IPS thinkpads are fantastic
fiw3rh,To the point I avoid using it
fi5zp1,Weird to [doublepost](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/fi5xg4/refurb_t460_purchase/) two threads with different layout five minutes apart.......
fi5zp1,I have a T460 with identical specs. I just purchased it a few months ago. I moved over to it from a mid 2010 MacBook Pro. Performance is a big step up from my old Mac. I added a 1TB ssd to mine and itâ€™s quick!
fi3c9b,"No. Unfortunately, since the move away from xvideo as the display a couple years back, performance of kdenlive has been pretty abysmal. I built an I7 desktop and it just doesn't do it anywhere near as well as other programs (including openshot)."
fi3c9b,"kdenlive is fucking weird. Can edit videos recorded with my smartphone on my slow ass 2005 HP laptop with no lag, yet get like 1 frame a minute on a 360p downloaded youtube video. Perhaps you could use FFMPEG to re-encode your clips before importing them into kdenlive and see if it runs better?"
fi3c9b,"You should use a desktop rather than a laptop. If you have $300 budget, try a hackintosh desktop by yourself. You will be satisfied with that."
fi3c9b,"Use video proxy, you don't need powerfull laptop .... I used to do video editing in Linux with Shotcut and video proxy on my T480S"
fi2esy,"I have just yesterday had a super bad experience with a new P43s (Nvidia Quadro p520, i7). Laptop worked OK with stock distribution, but installing the native nvidia-driver package caused the laptop to refuse to even power on again once it had gone to sleep. Couldn't even hard reset it.There are known to be problems between recent (4.8+) kernels and Nvidia cards and power management, but I didn't realise it would be that bad, I was expecting to maybe do some hacking around with ACPI settings and kernel params and get around it. But this was... worse than expected."
fi2esy,"Easy to install, difficult things is to get rid of fully disabling dgpu to optimize battery runtime. Prime is the best driver to use at this time but you still need to manually dgpu if acpi\_call method is not available"
fi2esy,a!
fi2esy,"I have Manjaro KDE on mine, and it seems to work ok, but I have no idea which graphic card is used when (or used at all)."
fi2esy,"Usually its no problem, but fm time to time it is.I had to blacklist noveau driver when installing fedora recently directly in grub because it made the system crash. NB is a X1 extreme gen 2 and the graphic card is a NVIDIA Corporation TU117M \[GeForce GTX 1650 Mobile / Max-Q\]"
fi2esy,It's just kind of annoying. Prepare to edit config files and stuff on your own.. never never use nvidia-xconfig utility though!
fhp4nr,This is a scam. Seller sends trackable item ie a letter to comply with ebay's demands of shipping something and then hopes youll actually wait till any return window or buyer protection blows over (when needed these sellers often have quite an arsenal of other reasons why everything is delayed).Get your money back asap before the seller runs off with it.
fhp4nr,"To eBay's system, your order got delivered and has been fulfilled, since tracking shows the 'package' has been delivered.I've seen this before but never experienced it first hand.I would let eBay know about this. Your period for returns/refunds starts with day of delivery, in this case day of delivery of the letter.So let eBay know that you have in fact not received the goods yet.I do not think this is a stunt or that the seller won't send you the screen in a reasonable amount of time. I believe this is their way of trying to trick eBay's systems into believing that they are very fast and reliable on fulfilling orders, to maybe get some higher ranking on their platform."
fhp4nr,Don't touch those sellers with a barge pole!What kind of an impertinence is that?But what's most suspicious is the fact that they didn't send you an email as everybody else would have done but a pretentious letter. Very suspicious!
fhp4nr,"As others have already pointed out, this has some of the hallmarks of a scam, but I suspect this is just a case of a sloppy business practice.This eBay seller, browngranite, has [been an eBay member since Sep 30, 2002](https://www.ebay.com/usr/browngranite). They have a [99.3% positive feedback rating](https://www.ebay.com/fdbk/feedback_profile/browngranite?filter=feedback_page:RECEIVED_AS_SELLER) with over 83,790 reviews as a seller.At least one other review shown [here](https://www.ebay.com/fdbk/feedback_profile/browngranite?filter=feedback_page:RECEIVED_AS_SELLER) mentions this ""sent letter instead of the item"" practice, so they've apparently done this before.Not defending how they're handling this, but I'd be willing to bet it's not a scam."
fhp4nr,Seems weird that they wouldn't just message you on ebay to let you know it was shipping from elsewhere. I'd still leave a negative review cuz that's not the product you expected to arrive. I hope you get your stuff though.
fhp4nr,I would first ask what's going on ? Maybe it's actually correct what's stated in your letter. Did you paid with PayPal ? So your covered for 180 days
fhp4nr,"eBayer browngranite seems to only sell ""compatibles"", personally I'd avoid him."
fhp4nr,LCD sellers are universally scammers it seems. they either send the wrong screens and lie about what they are or do weird stuff like this
fhp4nr,"OK, wrapping this up for anyone that is interested. I received a ""compatible"" screen today. I'm using it for an x250 mod experiment so I'm not concerned that it isn't the exact one I wanted it looks amazing, so no complaints. They made good on it. I spoke with ""Natasha"" on the phone and she was really helpful. Soooo...happy ending I guess?Anyway, I can imagine it would be possible to contact them and ask for a specific LCD model, as it seems they have several warehouses in the USA. I'm hoping that's true, as I have some ideas for screen mods."
fhehvr,"Had it for work,second hand after it had 2y of usage, it lasted another 3y with me, everyday intense usage.Had to change it because of the battery (third battery change) and the low-res screen.Built like a tank, modular and fairly expansible, still had a hassle-free docking system (also with linux, I had no issues).One of the thing I liked the most was the build quality, you could pick it up by the screen bezel without many worries.  It was a machine that silently screamed ""you can use me as a blunt weapon and STILL work like always afterwards"".The one downside I found is the screen resolution, mine was the lowest one, 1366x768 and it became difficult to use it. (couldn't change panel since it was not mine).10/10, would own again."
fhehvr,"How do you find the adobe apps on it, enough power?"
fhehvr,I used a t410 all the way through high school and then got a t480 when I went to college. Now my parents use the t410 for email and stuff. T480 is probably the best laptop I've ever had.
fhgkw5,"If your 15 inch MBP is the i7, then it has the 4870hq, which is much more powerful than the 2520m, or any compatible CPU for the T420. I have a T420, and if you're looking to swap out your MBP, I'd recommend a ThinkPad W541. Swap the CPU for the 4940mx or 4910mq. That'll give you slightly more performance, and they have not only dedicated graphics, but thunderbolt 2 allowing for eGPU expansion if necessary.Edit: also can be configured with a 3k display and 32gb of ram.Edit 2: I'd recommend a T430 if you want USB 3.0, but if you're fine with USB 2.0, then grab the t420 if it'll be fine, then throw in an i7-2670qm, 16gb of ram, and go with it. I ***love*** my t420. It came with the 1600x900 display, a 2520m, and 8gb of ram. I upgraded to 16gb and a 2670qm, and it's still fast enough for everything I need it for. Gaming takes place on my Ryzen 2600/Vega 64 desktop."
fhgkw5,I have a T420. What kind of softwares are you using? I can test it out and report back my findings if you want. I use VS code daily and it has no problems. But not sure what your setup is for your class.
fheqqv,My e570 does this. It'll be fine at 20-30% then it's slams down to 5% literally instantly and turns off. Pretty pissed off cus the batter was only 2 years old when it started doing it
fheqqv,"Likely a faulty cell in the battery. Try re-calibrating it, if that doesn't help then replace."
fh0jrb,"The iGPU doesnâ€™t support HDMI 2.0, so youâ€™ll only get higher than 1080p at low refresh rates.Use DP if you can."
fh0jrb,Are u on latest bios and driver ?
fgzbsw,Very good deal
fgzbsw,"Yep, excellent deal.  For either an X270 or X280."
fgzbsw,I think you just wanted to brag.
fgzbsw,I saw some reviews and they say x280 is the worst and to stick with the x270.
fgve1o,You opened the lid at too steep of an angle as if it were a door. The video demonstrates not to do that. Warranty claim or order another one is best option at this point.
fgve1o,I also own a T480 and I have to fully agree on this. You need to be extremely careful not to lift the latches up too far or else they *will* break. After opening up my T480 multiple times with this in mind and acting very cautiously every time they still show light signs of chipping. There seems to be no correct way of lifting them up without causing additive damage over time.That being said everything else on the T480 is rock solid and won't break with ease. And thankfully bottom cover replacements are not expensive.Also Mil-Spec in this case has nothing to do with the actual disassembly according to [MIL-STD-810](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIL-STD-810) which the T480 is certified as. This certification is about how environmental factors like air humidity etc. don't affect the system to a certain degree. These standards are not independently certified by any third party which often results in misleading marketing. I have no doubts the T480 doesn't comply with these standards though.
fglhou,you *stole* your first Thinkpad for that price ;)
fglhou,How the hell do you people pull off stuff like this?
fglhou,Great! Specs?
fglhou,"Every once in awhile, you just get lucky....If you're Irish, it helps LOL"
fglhou,That's insane. I thought $200 was good for mine...damn. Congrats! It's a lovely machine.
fglhou,"That's awesome! I scored a t440p for 70 with prodock included, a t440p for $50, and today an L440 for $20.  Nice score!"
fglhou,I'm so fucking jealous of you right now.
fgg50h,This looks so WRONG
fgg50h,cursed\_image
fgg50h,Dell is top quality on laptops no doubt. We need more of Latitude/Thinkpad varieties.
fgg50h,"Sorry, can't go with ya on this one."
fgg50h,I'm not sure how to feel
fgg50h,https://i.imgur.com/P6PvsLi.jpg
fgg50h,This hurts my brain. I'm an overflowing bucket of conflicting emotions over this.
fgg50h,"Sacrilege! That is just wrong on so MANY levels, it's obscene..."
fgg50h,r/jankpad kind of
fgg50h,I feel uncomfortable
fgg50h,Dell will be a better alternative compared to cheap plastic new thinkpads. Specially t480. I can't imagine I paid extra money for durable machine and got some plastic shit with the half of the features mentioned not working. almost all the dell offerings have better build quality. Stay avoid new thinkpads at any price
fgosxq,"If it has a license key sticker, you donâ€™t need to pay for windows"
fgosxq,"1) I would honestly recommend something like Manjaro (arch based but much more noob friendly). Manjaro is rolling-release (not like Ubuntu)  just as a heads-up. Manjaro also comes with different ""flavors"" so you can use different window managers/desktop managers with a supported release.2) yeah it is just powering through it. Whatever OS you get installed, disable the touchpad and you will come around to it pretty quickly.4) java dev should be pretty much the same. Most Professors will use an IDE or if they have you using the command line it would be UNIX focused anyway (Mac/Linux/BSD). My major tip is get started with vim out of the gate; it's lightweight, powerful, and everywhere.5) take a look at some of the referenced packages for Linux and ThinkPads. [See this](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/thinkpad-scripts/) and [this (focused on the tablet version)](https://codeablereason.wordpress.com/2017/03/14/set-up-x230-tablet/)"
fgosxq,You can just install win 10for free. It has an annoying thing on bottom right corner but it fine. If youâ€™re a student you can grab a free student edition. Learn to use the red nub. Comes in handy when using the laptop on your lap or tight spaces. Then you can put Ubuntu on top in windows and access it when you need to which at your level is handy to have. Going full Linux is a bit much if all you want to do is learn Java but you might as well have something to play with. Youâ€™ll eventually will have to learn the Unix/Linux environment but I am a big proponent for focusing and mastering what you need at the moment. Probably install the java ide that your class is using but always test it in another environment like repl it. This way you know your code works. Remember donâ€™t spend so much time in tools but focus in the actual material.
fgosxq,"I am going to address just #1: Give Ubuntu Mate a try.  It's Ubuntu, so there is lots of support and it's running Mate DE, which just works and it should be quite easy to use coming from Windows."
fgosxq,There are Windows 10 keys all over ebay typically for less than $5. They are grey market keys but they work fine. I've used several with no issues.edit: spelling
fgowin,I had one of the LG panels in my X240 I am sure of it. had lots of ghosting/retention. then it magicly failed with occasional horizontal lines when it got warm :|. might not be the same LG panels the X250 uses but it wasnt great.If he is running Windows 10 then just put a FHD panel in and turn up the display scaling. Windows 10 will probably default it to like 150% which makes it about the look about the same size as the og 1366x768 panel
fgbmz4,Arenâ€™t thinkpads waterproof?
fgbmz4,"Yes, you can expect more problems in the future. Water damage is a slow killer, sometimes it kills machines instantly but most times it can take weeks/months for problems to appear. It is also very difficult to say what might fail and when as every case is different. Yours might be one of the worse ones, whereas spilled water more or less is forced in a best-of-a-bad-situation route in an attempt to save many of the more important components your case could be worse because condensation pretty much can form wherever there's any air so pretty much everywhere in the machine. On the upside, the minerals found in tap or bottled water are not present in condensation so this removes one potentially damaging factor, however connectors and components inside will still oxidize over time. The fact that the machine didnt turn on initially is a very solid indication that the water got in places that are important for the machines function. Also, i dont think the battery is your biggest problem, those are reasonably easy and cheaply replaced (compared to a motherboard for example).It is of also possible that you were very lucky and no permanent damage was done, as long as you expect the worst (backup your important data on regular intervals) then you'll avoid big problems with lost work and disappointment if the machine does give up the ghost eventually."
fgbmz4,"Thinkpads arenâ€™t waterproof. Keyboards on the T series that Iâ€™ve owned or had company issued are spill protected, but the underlying components canâ€™t handle water. Iâ€™ve experienced times when the machine refuses to start when it is cold, say after being in a car trunk in winter, until it warms up a bit. If you didnâ€™t visibly see condensed water on the machine, like heavy dew, I donâ€™t think you have much to worry about. Even then, it isnâ€™t like theyâ€™re that fragile. A sheen of condensation isnâ€™t the same as leaving it out in driving rain. The spec for consumer electronics tends to be 0-95% r.h. Non-condensing. And boards tend to have a bit of a coating to keep them from absorbing water from normal humidity levels. Otherwise, no laptop would survive a Florida summer."
fgbmz4,How cold was it? Was the laptop still cold when you tried switching it on? If it was around 0Â° or colder it could also be the battery that stopped working. This would only be temporary and would not have any permanent effect.
fgbmz4,"Just a PSA for any kind of electronics with vents or openings in the case (eg cameras, PCs, recording equipment etc.):  Always allow for the device to acclimate if you move it from one environment to a significantly warmer environment.Water vapor in the warm air can condensate on the cold internals of your device and might damage them when you power it up."
ffjhny,"Maybe humble, but also great.Almost mistook the x100e for a x230."
ffjhny,"From left to right: T430, R50e, X100e"
ffjhny,"Whatever makes our hearts beat faster, thumbs up, comrade!"

ffhht5,Yesss
ffhht5,Whoâ€™s the seller? I just ordered one and I think itâ€™s this exact listing! If so I can give more details tomorrow when I get mine.
ffhht5,"Not bad, the going rate about a year or so ago for decent x240s was $140 when I was selling them. This looks alright to me."
ffhht5,Yes.
ffhht5,8gb ram and an SSD large enough for a Linux image is pretty solid at that price!
ffhht5,Are you not going to be hit by extra tax and tax processing payments on receipt? Like in the UK? Otherwise not a bad deal at all considering RAM and SSD :)
ffhht5,"I certainly hope so, I bought one a few days ago from the same listing (I think)."
ffnc6q,"I have a P50 and a T480.In terms of build quality, the P50 is made for a mission to Mercury. I can't imagine what the build difference is compared to an L series. Lenovo does 5 year warranties on the P50. But what does this mean in practice? Well, it's a nominal 45W CPU, and the P50 is heavy because of all the cooling. It won't throttle under load, unlike the T series or L series. So anything that maxes out the CPU for more than a minute, the P50 will start to pull away in terms of performance. Under max load it gets to about 65 degrees in my office. The cooling is there for the nvidia GPU being maxxed out as well as the CPU. That's also why it's not USB-C. Even in 2020 USB-C isn't specified to deliver the  power that the P50 will draw under high load. The keyboard is much nicer than my T480. The T480 keyboard is good, but the P50 is great. However, that may be luck of the draw. It's also very expandable, with 4 RAM slots and the SSDs get 4 lanes. And it's heavy. I use linux with mine. With the nvidia card powered down, it idles < 5w so battery life is quite good. This is basically all-day life. When the quadro is on, not so much. To use external displays, the nvidia card must be on. So if you are running on battery while connected to external displays, battery life will be quite poor."
ffnc6q,"Looking at the benchmarks, looks like the 6700HQ has the edge over the 8250U in most tasks. Which makes sense since the H/HQ CPUs are all around 45W TDP vs the 15-25 of the U.[https://www.notebookcheck.net/8250U-vs-6700HQ-vs-6970HQ\_9206\_6973\_8017.247596.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/8250U-vs-6700HQ-vs-6970HQ_9206_6973_8017.247596.0.html)&#x200B;Other than that, are you going from the 1366x768 display to the 1080 one? That'll be a huge leap. The 768 display is atrocious."
ffnc6q,"There's an ongoing USB-C charging mod, but the P series is not covered at the moment. ~~I don't think it's likely it'll ever get support for it due to the presumably higher power draw, but no harm keeping tabs on it:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/fds7hb/psa\_usb\_c\_charging\_mod\_for\_t\_and\_x\_series\_drop\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/fds7hb/psa_usb_c_charging_mod_for_t_and_x_series_drop_in/)~~ After reading the well-written purchase page linked via Reddit, it's extremely unlikely that the 170W power draw will ever be supported: Even the newer P series with built-in USB-C and PD support will charge slower via it.The other spec you should be more concerned is the storage. Unless the 256 GB SSD is a particularly bad unit, otherwise it's likely that its all-round performance will beat the 500 GB HDD. This has heavy implications from start-up speeds to disk-intensive activities (e.g. video editing)."
ffj7mx,I always wondered about that on a surface laptop: doesnt that get messy in just 72 hours?Second question: what you think of the x1 after the surface?
ffj7mx,No offence but it looks nothing like Alcantara.
ffj7mx,I like it! I think stylistically I would have just done the entire border around the keyboard as well. But man it's really cool. These carbons are so thin and they get keyboard imprinted on the screen sometimes so this modification might also help prevent your screen from scratches as well. Would you mind sharing the Amazon link for the suede you used? Thanks!
ffaa7z,""" I Heard thode T14 will have AMD, is it better than Intel based?""... It's diffrent...Depends on your use case...

ff7fs3,"ThinkPad W540 here, 7260AC factory card in it, never had any issues so far in the 1+ years I've had it. I just ordered a 7265AC to replace it, and it arrived today (Saturday) and of course me being the bonehead I am I *presumed* because I specifically ordered a Lenovo FRU part (it's an actual Lenovo supplied 7265AC card) that it would work in my W540 but of course the damned stupid dumbass no-good-reason-to-exist-at-all whitelist BS won't allow the card to work.So, I'm actually now considering finally getting the damned chip programmer to read out the BIOS and have someone mod a BIOS file for me so I can finally get that damned stupid dumbass no-good-reason-to-exist-at-all whitelist BS out of ***my laptop*** once and for all.Can't speak for why you might be having so many issues, really. Personally I still use Windows 7 and will for years to come - the recent extended service updates are easily available and my W540 screams with Windows 7 Pro on it (so does the Latitude XT2 I'm typing this post on, actually).Good luck working out a solution...And a recommendation:Install the Enterprise version of Lenovo Vantage if you must use Windows 10 - don't install it from the Windows Store. That version is updated regularly and they've been stripping features that are very useful (like battery charging thresholds) out of it. The Enterprise client doesn't have that issue, and won't be changed for a long, long time to come.You can get the Enterprise version (get rid of the Windows Store one, uninstall it or just do another fresh clean installation) here:https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/hf003321Click the ""Version 20.1908.3.0 (Application and Deployment Guide)"" link near the top, download the file, extract the contents and follow the instructions. It's not a simple .exe installer because it's a Windows ""app"" so it requires a slightly different installation procedure.Have fun, always..."
ff7fs3,I've found the issue! Literally only driver [17.15.0.5](https://17.15.0.5) works for this device + NIC combo that I have. Does anyone know a safe way to download Intel AC7260 [17.15.0.5](https://17.15.0.5) driver? I've checked a multitude of websites but unsure of the safest repository.

One of the most hassle free wifi cards I have usedThe dual band intel card in the T430 was pure shit though. Wouldnt link at full speed ever so maybe a dud
ff1dk8,"Get rid of the Windows Store installed version of Lenovo Vantage, it sucks, and with each update it just gets worse. Get the Enterprise version which does ***NOT*** update from the Windows Store, will remain as it is for a very long time to come, and retains features of the original Vantage like setting battery charge thresholds and other things that have been slowly removed from the all-too-frequently updated version from the Windows Store.Get the Enterprise version here:https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/hf003321Uninstall/remove the Windows Store version (however that's done, I'm not using Windows 10 on my ThinkPad W540), download the Zip file at the top, extract it, install it, and you'll be doing better in the long run.Good luck..."

feiypz,"From personal experience yes. I play some older games and the igpu in my i7-4800mq is considerably less capable. The gt730m is absolute garbage, but it is better garbage than the igpu. I donâ€™t know why people think the Intel graphics are better but it is simply not true."
feiypz,nah
feiypz,"Depends on what you want to do. For me? Yes, worth it. I get between 25%, and 40% better performance than with the iGPU, depending on what I'm doing."

fe3ftz,"Yes, the T420 came with two different screen options, one with a max. resolution of 1366x768, the other with 1600x900. If you want, you can upgrade the screen to the 1600x900 one. It can be bought for $50-60. You'll also need a new screen cable, there are plenty of guides and experiences from people who have done the upgrade on this subreddit."
fe3ftz,">So what does that mean? -- that the actual, physical monitor on the old machine is designed to support 1600x900, and the one on the new machine isn't? (I'm not tech-illiterate or anything, but this is the first time it's ever even occurred to me that laptops may have different screens with different specs.)This is exactly whats going on here. You should see 't420' more as a model family than an actual unique model, the components in these machines vary and could to some extent even be configured to order for whatever your company needs. Many brands do this to some extent.Even more fun, even if you order two machines with similar resolution panels you could end up with two quite different looking screens... lenovo for one is great at ordering more-or-less the same panels from many different manufacturers (they kinda have to with the numbers they need) and each one will be ever so slightly different with the buyer not knowing what he will receive until he has the machine in hand."
fe3ftz,"Yeah the same laptop comes in various specifications (includes the display as well).On a side note, there is an aftermarket display adapter that allows you to upgrade your t420 with a 1080p IPS panel. Approximately 100USD for both the display panel and adapter."

fdmpdj,"**Photos here**: https://imgur.com/a/ZLeiwdD**Video here**: https://youtu.be/9nDrqKb1akMAnother night, another idea. Yesterday's ""Brainless ThinkPad"" https://old.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/fd0xee/ which works by miracast wireless display sharing, and is totally wireless/untethered with the help of an Anker USB powerbank, worked well with my T480s, my S10, and my desktop... but the experience was mirroring screens or extending desktops, which can be useful for a portable second monitor or portable 'notebook' type experiencebut it it just so much more polished with Samsung DeX. By plugging in a simple and cheap (mine cost 8 Sterling pound) Lenovo USB-C to HDMI adapter, and HDMI-to-eDP LCD driver board, I was able to use the DeX experience on the Brainless ThinkPad as a much more laptop-like experience. This thing is going to kill chromebooks and low end laptops. Best thing is that it can last you years and years, and every time you upgrade your phone you're upgrading the ""Brain"" of your Brainless ThinkPad**How it works:** The S10 acts as a touchpad, the ThinkPad Tablet 2 bluetooth keyboard is a keyboard with optical trackpoint (suboptimal but I'll take it), and the wireless untethered screen is... just that :)For those wondering, yes such a product is *almost* available (it's a Kickstarter with a possibly shipping date of July 2020) from another vendor NexDock for $250 (and technically some later versions of HP's Lapdock X3 works in such a way but cost $600US new a few years ago)... but you can build this at home today and have an arguably better experience and more versatile device (thanks to wireless screen sharing via miracast adapter). And before that in the early 2010s, the Asus Transformer, Asus PadFone, and Motorola Atrix all did similar things (albeit in a much worse and practically unusable way). **Ingredients:** * Brainless ThinkPad (as previously described)* Wireless untethered ThinkPad display (as previously described)* Recent model Samsung phone (I think anything newer than and including S8, Note 8, S9, Note 9, S10, Note 10, S20 range) - although you may get a similar experience from any newer Android phone with desktop mode* USB-C to HDMI adapterNext steps (not already discussed in yesterday's post)* 3D printed enclosure to tuck and tidy everything* Switchable HDMI (have a 3-input HDMI switch I'll use without the casing) so you can use either HDMI-in, DeX mode, or Wireless Display mode without unplugging anything* Anker Slim powerbank (I have 3 different ones on the way) to reduce battery weight 50%* POSSIBLE ThinkPad X61 enclosure - as I have spare parts laying around from an X61 project, the ThinkPad Tablet 2 bluetooth keyboard is almost a perfect fit, and the 3:2 2160x1440p 12"" screen I ordered for another X61 ""Max Res"" project (update coming in late March/early April) also fits in the X61 screen/lid so it can be 'retro style' ;)"
fdmpdj,"Hi mate, would it be possible to explain once again how all parts and all connections in this configuration?What is plugged into the phone? A USB-C to HDMI? Why do you say ""wireless"" display then? How is the the keyboard connected to the phone?"
fdmpdj,"He he imagining my ideal ""brainless Thinkpad"":* X201/X220 style keyboard (required for me)* 4\*3 hi-res screen* T460+ style trackpad* overpowered cheap phone like some Plus One with 8Gb RAM running Linux/Cubes OS* wireless everything - no physical connection to phone to reduce wear and tearAll features apart from keyboard optional :) More of a pipe dream I guess..

fd56pb,"Had some issues getting the dual boot finally working correctly and then optimizing Ubuntu. But now everything is perfect. This is my 2nd ThinkPad, but the 1st belonged to my last job. But, this beauty is all mine!"
fd56pb,What led you to choose the P53?  I ask because the base 4-core CPU (and by extension a lower-end GPU thanks to Lenovo's configuration segmentation) doesn't strike me as really leveraging the strengths of the P53 platform vs. other kinds of ThinkPads.
fddaf5,"If you need so much ram why not get the p53/p73 or whatever their refreshed models are going to be called? I don't think the other models support as much as those (up to 128gb). Even the P1 only goes up to 64gb. The P series also have much more powerful CPUs except for the ""s"" variants"
fddaf5,"I'm in a fairly similar situation. I'm looking to replace my X270 with something with a lot more power, as I use it to run statistical models in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/). (In R, under Arch Linux.) For really big models I have a compute server, but it's incredibly useful to test smaller things locally. Discrete GPU support is really necessary for me, as is as much RAM as possible.I'm far from an expert, but I've just spent a few hours comparing the upcoming T14 with the X1 Extreme, and various other models. This will be my work and personal machine that I will be carrying basically everywhere -- home to work and back on a bike, on a plane, conferences, etc. I really want the 14"" screen for that portability. Battery life really isn't that important for me, provided I get a few hours.For pure performance I'll be getting a desktop, but for the balance of a laptop that I can actually carry around and use for writing up papers, I'm making the compromise against pure performance and holding out for the T14. I could go for an X1 Extreme, but I'd hate that large a footprint for when I'm sitting back on the sofa at home. A colleague has a P53 and I can't imagine lugging that thing around.(I'm just hoping that the T14 will have appropriate PCIe lanes for an eGPU.)This is where I am after a day or so of weighing up options, but I'd be very happy to hear what people think."

To buy it, check amazon or newegg.I would advice to buy another model of laptop since the main components, are not upgradeable for one (HDD and Ram) and in most cases, maxing these out as in max ram and hdd/ ssd space, would cost allot. Meanwhile purchasing a laptop that does part is upgradeable, you can change them gradually or right away in ky opinion. Hope this info would help you."
ct5n5k,"I know this sucks, but actually idk if the backpack itself has a warranty. Anyways you still can take it to an acer reseller, or the place you bought it from, if possible"
ct5n5k,Did you buy it with a laptop? Use that SNID.   You didn't say where you purchased the backpack. Try returning to the retailer.
cnsj4o,"Make sure you really are looking at the Nvidia Utility instead of the Windows display settings.Which GPU do you have installed?   Did you check for an updated version of the Nvidia Control Panel or GPU driver update?Meanwhile, this was discussed in  [/r/nvidia/comments/agfdxk/enabling\_freesync\_with\_acer\_xfa240/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/agfdxk/enabling_freesync_with_acer_xfa240/)"
c8andk,It is a Acer Aspire one cloudbook 14
c8andk,Try reseating the LCD cables inside of the laptop
c8andk,"If this still persist, it's best to refer to a Acer official repair specialist, probably due to impact on your laptop screen before, making this happened."
c8andk,"Do it the conventional way, unplug and plug again. If it doesnt work, it is probably something wrong with your screen pixels, best to reach out to an aftersale consultant."
c7l37y,"You dont need to install the previous ones, only the latest, but you really should not update the bios unless something is wrong with your system"
c7l37y,"Hello, I had the same issue as you do and I figured it out. Check it here: [https://community.acer.com/en/discussion/564333/strange-acer-predator-helios-300-can-not-update-bios#latest](https://community.acer.com/en/discussion/564333/strange-acer-predator-helios-300-can-not-update-bios#latest)When I updated my bios, 1.19 at that moment, I took all of them sequentially. Bios is something you don't want to screw. Better be safe than sorry."
c2yexx,Is meant to show you that the laptop is charging. You never saw that battery icon with a lightning in it ever in your life?
c2yexx,You got them mixed up. The lights are located on the right of the icons.
c2yexx,"Yeah, that what I mean. I am asking about the light that is located right to Bulb icon (The same light is located on left of Battery icon). So totally, the light that is located in between the Bulb Icon and Battery icon. What's that for.????"
c2yexx,"Usually that's the hard drive activity light, but the icon of a bulb is puzzling."
c2yexx,That light is basically useless...it is used to tell if your laptop is turned ON or off. I Thought the light will turn orange once laptop enters sleep but that's not the case!!
bkrqx6,"I would get that checked asap. Had this issue on my Helios 300 G3-571 last year, apparantly bestbuy told me a screw was missing off my heatsink. Act quickly dude"
bkrqx6,"Could be a thermal paste problem? I'd definitely take it back and ask for them to have a look, ive got a helios 300 with same specs and undervolted i never get that hot"
bkrqx6,"I got a nitro 5 and same problem, I wanted to go to the shop to get them fixed but didnâ€™t have time so far, but maybe it is just normal since both of ours are like this. Also  didnâ€™t undervolt yet, can you tell me how you undervolted?"
bkrqx6,"Yes it did. With sny pc if the Heatsink isnt properly seated from all four sides, then it will not make proper contact with the chip and cause heating issues."

ao9icl,"The cheaper Acers usually does not feature any software that can control the backlight. Have you tried holding down the FN key and pressing the key 'F9""?"
adxnwu,yeah... i want this really bad. 
a2ed5d,The laptop is great. The battery is not that good if you are gaming. If you are going on google chrome and youtube the battery is longer than gaming. 
93tg4i,Update: They're sending me a shipping label to have it repaired.
93tg4i,"I had my Aspire 5 ""swapped"" to a new one after 1 weeks of the initial purchase because of backlight bleeding and my new notebook has that issue as well."
8l7ul4,which model do you have?
