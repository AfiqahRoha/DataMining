Data Mining Project (WQD7005)

### Project title: Text mining on customer feedbacks of different laptop brands.

My group and I aim to do an analysis of customer feedbacks of different laptop brands such as Apple, Dell, Asus, Acer and Lenovo by using data from social media. In this Github you will be able to see our progress to achieve that objective. There are a total of five milestones for this project.

#### Milestone 1 - Web scraping the data:

We crawl data from social media such as Reddit to get an insight from laptop users about popular laptop brands. The following information is a bit of an insight for those who are unfamiliar with Reddit:
>> Reddit is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, and images, which are then voted up or down by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called "subreddits", which cover a variety of topics. Submissions with more up-votes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough up-votes, ultimately on the site's front page. (source: Wikipedia)
