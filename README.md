Data Mining Project - 2019_2020 Semester 2

Project title: Text mining on customer feedbacks of different laptop brands.
My group and I aim to do an analysis of customer feedbacks of different laptop brands such as Apple, Dell, Asus, Acer and Lenovo by using data from social media. In this Github you will be able to see our progress to achieve that objective. There are a total of five milestones for this project.

Milestone 1 - Web scraping the data
We crawl data from social media such as Reddit to get an insight from laptop users about popular brands.
