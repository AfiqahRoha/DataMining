fhh9ug,"1: Mobile Ryzen 4000 is too close not to wait.

https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-Ryzen-4000-laptop-prices-and-release-dates-accidentally-leaked-by-Canadian-retailers.457173.0.html

2: 9750H runs hot on cooling much better than the G3's."
fhh9ug,"Yes, it will shred CS:GO even on max. 

What the CPU number means:

*  **i7:** Intel's second fastest line of consumer CPUs, after the i9 and before the i5.
* **9:** The 9th-generation of i7s, also known as Coffee Lake.
* **750:** Fastest chip in this line (depending on the final letter). Intel tend to go up to 750.
* **H:** Fastest laptop chip, but can be power-hungry."
fhh9ug,The Gpu is not on par with the cpu and the 512 ssd is bare minimum so more storage would be good
fhh9ug,"Hey,

Short answer, yes.

Long answer: [**Dell Gaming G3 15 3590**](https://noteb.com/?model/model.php?conf=12226235585877000192_3259&ex=USD&ref=starchaser) is a decent gaming laptop. It's the budget-friendly version of the G5/G7 so it doesn't have the best build quality. I7-9750H is a six-core processor that combined with GTX 1660 TI Max-Q will allow you to play most AAA games in high settings. This laptop will handle whatever you will throw at it with no problems but I do recommend undervolting.

What is your budget? Maybe we can find something better."
fhh9ug,Yeah it should work our week unless you plan on running super intense games like Red dead 2 and Ultra settings or something
fhi46b,"HP are having a sale right now which means you can get [this Envy 13](https://store.hp.com/us/en/ConfigureView?langId=-1&storeId=10151&catalogId=10051&catEntryId=3074457345619203824&urlLangId=&quantity=1&color=natural+silver) for just $969. It comes with an 8th-gen Core i7 (this is enough, Intel's upgrades are very incremental), a GeForce MX250, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. I also specced it with Windows 10 Pro, which you said you wanted and is cheaper than upgrading. 

The only thing it doesn't have is USB-C charging. It does have a USB-C port, but that's officially for data transfer only. This is such a good deal that I wouldn't let that stop you, however."

512GB Storage (NVMe)

4K Screen (Windows will scale it.)Pen storage, Since you are working on Photo stuff, that may be useful for you.You can use the left over funds to get a Pro license

If you plan to dock this little guy for more screens in  the future or something a Dell D6000 will do what you need.

Starting with 8th gen, i5s and i7s in the mobile market with the ""U"" at the end are all Quad cores

The 10th Gen are bit stranger the i7-10710U is a Six core hyper-threaded to 12 (6C/12T)The one I have suggested is a quad core but can do a lot of damage for what you are after.I feel that this setup would last you (not figuring in your skill level and growth of that skill) will satisfy you for every bit of three to four years. Now if this does not seem like it, please let me know.

It also is dependent on your liking, some people do not like Dell at all."

fgcrwz,"It depends how much power you need, but something from Acer's ConceptD line might be what you need. There are two I would recommend, based on how much power you need:

* **ConceptD 5:** 9th-gen Core i7, RTX 2060, 16GB of RAM, a terabyte of SSD storage and a 17"" screen for £2229
* **ConceptD 7:** 9th-gen Core i7, RTX 2080, 32GB of RAM, a terabyte of SSD storage and a 15"" screen for £2799

Both models are 4K with full Adobe RGB coverage and a deltaV of ""less than 2."" Not sure what that means.

ffyuog,"Hi, I think that the laptops that have been recommended so far are bad options. They are typical consumer grade laptops, so they aren't very likely to last a long time. Instead, I think that you need a business grade laptop since they are the most reliable and durable.

ffyuog,"Hey,

Just wanted to say congrats on getting in. If by chance you’re pursuing your J.D. at Costco, they may offer a student discount."
ffyuog,"i don't have a specific recommendation, but here's my story: 
i'm also in law school (2L), the summer before law school i bought a xps 13. it had a ton of issues and i returned it. 
i got an hp envy 13 instead. in two years, it needed the motherboard replaced twice (once because the usb-c port died, once because it was just... chugging for no reason). so i got a refund the second time it needed a mobo, and got a thinkpad x1 carbon instead....which in a few weeks had touchpad issues. i returned it and got a new one, and it's been fine... so far. 

so... whatever you get could have reliability issues, honestly, but given thinkpads are built for enterprise, and given their reputation, i think they're a safer bet. (i also had a lenovo legion that had overheating issues, i returned it and built a desktop)"
ffyuog,"For ultra-thin on a budget (and $800 might not seem like much of a budget but it is when it comes to ultrabooks), Acer's Swift lineup is where it's at. The [Swift 5](https://store.acer.com/en-us/laptops/ultra-thin/swift-5-laptop-sf514-53t-52vu) is on sale currently for $549 (normally $799), and for your money you get an 8th-gen Core i5, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage. It also has a 14"" display and an HDMI output port, and Acer say it has an 8-hour battery life.

As for weight, it weighs 2.14 lb (just under a kilogram), and is 0.6"" thick (1.5 cm). And it should last you at least a couple of years, as long as you don't start gaming or doing anything massively intensive like video editing or CAD."

It is very lightweight and has a sturdy aluminum chassis which is ideal for moving about as it can take a few bumps and bruises.

ffyuog,"I would recommend this [Acer Swift 3](http://amazon.com/dp/B07MRWRHGC/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because of the following: 

* It weighs 2.9lbs which is light like you want.
* The casing made of brushed aluminum and looks very premium.
* The keyboard is a chiclet keyboard, typing on it feels spongy, but you get used to it quickly.
* Drag and drop sometimes doesn't work as intended, but that is easily fixed with software.
 
* Screen is glossy Full HD IPS, with very good viewing angles, the screen flickers at 200 Hz in a brightness level of 20%. if you have sensitive eyes might find this unpleasant (or you can get a headache if you are really sensitive).
 
*The main (and maybe only) con about this laptop is how dim the screen can get, as it is not usable in direct sunlight.
 
* Has very good heat management, and it doesn't throttle.
 
* Speakers provide very clear sounds, and the maximum volume is pretty loud.
 
 
* Battery life is very good at around 9-11 hours of usage on light to medium usage, so it matches your needs of good battery life.

But, the device that I think is pretty well built for the price is the [**Lenovo Legion Y540**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=6xJhMJDSy2I&mid=44583&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2F1XV-0001-00VJ3%3FDescription%3Dy540%252017%26cm_re%3Dy540_17-_-9SIAFVDAPF3290-_-Product%26quicklink%3Dtrue). It has a very solid hinge design, no gap between the laptop deck and display, so I think that the hinges will hold up. The 6-core i7 processor and GTX 1660 Ti graphics combination should be great for those kinds of games at high settings 1080p. It should also handle general use just fine too."
fg5djm,"Idk why not all the comments are showing up, but I received some notifications on my phone about more comments on this post, but when I go into the app to view them, there's nothing new.

* The outer shell is made almost entirely out of metal and as you mentioned build quality is the most important.
 * Keyboard is mechanical with RGB backlit.
* It has 3 USB type A, Ethernet, and mic and headphone jack and on the back an HDMI, and USB type C.
 
* 17.3 inch Screen is IPS with 144Hz refresh rate, with impressively small bezels, and a professional design.
 
* Lid can't be open with one hand.
 
* Fans get loud under intensive work, but that is normal with every good gaming laptop.
 
* Plenty of upgrade options as the chassis supports up to 32GB of ram, and 2 SSDs and 1 HDD.
* Heat management is great, it can get hot but it gets cool again pretty quickly once the fans kick in.
 
* Main con of the laptop is the trackpad, it is mediocre at best when you compare it to other laptops in the price range.
 
* Battery life during normal usage is around 3.5-4.5 hours and 1.5 hour during gaming.
 
* Speakers are down facing so during gaming, it is best to wear headphone since the fan gets loud during gaming as well.

For 720$ you're getting an H series processor, GTX 1650 graphics card, Full HD LED IPS display, SSD and room for an HDD, 2 memory slots, ~5H battery life, a very good peripheral port selection: 1 X USB-C 3.1, Thunderbolt, 3 X USB 3.1, 1 X LAN, SD card reader and a Backlit Chiclet keyboard, RGB LED. This laptop has a much better build quality than the one you had, GTX 1650 is much better than GTX 1050 3 GB - it's just under GTX 1060 and it also has excellent battery life for a gaming laptop.

ffx2qh,"I would recommend this [Acer Aspire 5](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TJ21K7T/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because of the following:

* It comes with 8th Gen, i5 quad core CPU.
* Slim, sleek.
 
* the lid of the device has a matte finish on its aluminum material. On the other side, the plastic material on the rest of the chassis is retained.
* its lid cannot be opened with a single hand. On the bright side, it is sturdy and prone to flexes. Moreover, we see an upgrade in the hinge department that leaves them a lot stronger than before.
* The narrow-bezel design offers more real estate for amazing images. Crisp, true-to-life colors come alive on a 15.6” Full HD IPS display with Acer Color Intelligence.

And since you didn’t mention the games you are going to play, and prefer more powerful GPU, then I would recommend this [Asus TUF FX505DT](https://www.amazon.com/R5-3550H-Processor-Graphics-FX505DT-AH51-Keyboard/dp/B07VBK4SYS/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) mainly because it offers great value for money and with high refresh range (which is very rare for this range), here is a review of it:
 
Specs:
 
* AMD Ryzen 5 R5-3550H Processor, GeForce GTX 1650 GPU, 8GB DDR4, 256GB PCIe SSD.
* It comes with GTX 1650  GPU and it will run most on medium to high settings,  You can check the below link to see how the  GTX 1650
* GPU  (scroll down for the FPs and settings expected or ctrl+f then type the name of your game).
https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-1650-Laptop-GPU.416044.0.html
 
 
* 120Hz 15.6"" Full HD (1920x1080) IPS screen with Thin Bezel, RGB keyboard, under 5 lbs.
* RJ-45, HDMI 2.0, USB 2.0 Type-A, 2x USB Type-A 3.1 Gen
 
Review:
 
* Con: All ports are on one side and it doesn't have USB type C.
* Con: Gets loud fans under heavy load like gaming.
 
* Pro: You can add an additional ram stick and additional 2.5 storage hard drive.
* Pro: Very good build quality and heat management (hot enough to be uncomfortable on your lap but not enough to throttle).
* Pro: Very good battery life up to 7-8 hours during non gaming usage.

I usually don't recommend XPS because they have some quality control issues but Dell has good support and they should replace it shortly if you get a faulty unit. It has a quad-core processor, a beautiful 4k display, PCIe SSD, over 6H battery life, decent peripheral port selection: 3 X USB-C 3.1, Thunderbolt, SD card reader and soldered RAM.

If 6H is not enough for your needs, let me know and I'll try to recommend something with a Full HD display.

fezvss,"Since you are looking for durability, I would recommend this [Eluktronics mech g2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R11SWT5/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20)  because it has great combination between value for money, weight, battery life, and performance.

* The outer shell is made almost entirely out of metal, so it's durable like you want.
* Keyboard is mechanical with RGB backlit.
* It has 3 USB type A, Ethernet, and mic and headphone jack and on the back an HDMI, and USB type C.
 
* Screen is IPS with 144Hz refresh rate, with impressively small bezels, and a professional design.
 
* Lid can't be open with one hand.
 
* Fans get loud under intensive work, but that is normal with every good gaming laptop.
 
* Plenty of upgrade options as the chassis supports up to 32GB of ram, and 2 SSDs and 1 HDD.
* Heat management is great, it can get hot but it gets cool again pretty quickly once the fans kick in.
 
* Main con of the laptop is the trackpad, it is mediocre at best when you compare it to other laptops in the price range.
 
* Battery life during normal usage is around 3.5-4.5 hours and 1.5 hour during gaming.
 
* Speakers are down facing so during gaming, it is best to wear headphone since the fan gets loud during gaming as well.

* Drag and drop sometimes doesn't work as intended, but that is easily fixed with software.
 
* Screen is glossy Full HD IPS, with very good viewing angles, the screen flickers at 200 Hz in a brightness level of 20%. if you have sensitive eyes might find this unpleasant (or you can get a headache if you are really sensitive).

* Has very good heat management, and it doesn't throttle.

This laptop is great for editing as it has a quad-core CPU, a fairly powerful GPU and most importantly a very color accurate screen. It is well built and has an aluminum chassis which is ideal for traveling. It can take a few bumps without breaking as well. Its SSD is both fast and reliable. Additionally, it has lots of RAM so you won't have any lag when you have 20+ tabs open while streaming and working on a few documents"
fdq1y0,"Hi, are you purchasing in the U.S?"
fdq1y0,"I would recommend this [MSI PS63 Modern](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PHMYDZJ/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because it is a great all around laptop, here is a short review:

***
 
And for intensive video editing work, you may need more powerful CPU, so if you can handle 5lbs, then I would recommend this [Acer Predator Helios 300 2019 version](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QXLFLXT/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=bkadamos_alltest-20&linkId=20da69aaddb5a2537cd27af5e34967d6&language=en_US) because it comes with everything you need, great value for money, 144Hz screen which is great for fast paced games, easily upgradeable, Latest CPU and GPU, Very good heat management, and here is a more detailed review :
 
* The top of the laptop plus the keyboard and palm area are metal.
* Screen bright enough for using outside in the shade but not in direct sunlight.
* GPU is powerful to run your games on medium to high settings.
* [Here is benchmark for the GPU performance](https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-1660-Ti-Laptop-Graphics-Card.386426.0.html).
* Laptop comes with Optimus to conserve battery.
* Keyboard is great, quiet, and have a nice feel.
* Keyboard has a numpad but narrower than the rest of the keyboard, and the arrow buttons shifted.
* Speakers are at the bottom and kinda muffed so a headset is recommended for when you are gaming.

A silent laptop is this: [**Lenovo Ideapad Legion Y740-15**](https://noteb.com/?model/model.php?conf=17718013727236999168_3234&ex=USD&ref=starchaser) but it doesn't have good battery life - you'll get 3 or 4H out of it but only if you manually switch Optimus on from Bios.

The [**Tongfang QC7 (MAG-15)**](https://noteb.com/?model/model.php?conf=5900413956733885896_3584&ex=USD&ref=starchaser) is the best option from my point of view, I see that it's sold with the brown keyboard - that's the silent one. It has ~7H battery life, six-core processor, GTX 1660 TI graphics, 144Hz display, only SSD as storage, 2 memory slots and a very good peripheral port selection: 1 X USB-C 3.1, Thunderbolt, 3 X USB 3.1, 1 X LAN, SD card reader.

fdq01u,"Eluktronics MAG-15 is really a good laptop and I'd be absolutely fine using it in class even as a university student haha.

Other laptops I can think of that is similar to the MAG-15 and suits your needs are the Gigabyte Aero 15 or the MSI GS65 which are both capable of having a 7+ hour battery life

If you're looking to find the cheapest laptop possible but still have the specs of the MAG-15, Aero 15 and GS65, the Acer Helios 300 is a good option too, and I also believe that laptop has a 4-5 hour battery life."
fdq01u,"check out the eluktronics Max-15 (not Mag-15) as that one has a membrane keyboard but also offers the option of a full RTX 2070 GPU while still being under 4 lbs.

Trade off is thunderbolt 3 and Wifi 6, but you can replace the Wifi card (youtube a tutorial its quite simple) so depends on your requirement of a thunderbolt port.

Other options is Gigabyte Aero 15 as the other commenter mentioned or HP Omen but the Omen has been reported to have some thermal issues.

Asus ROG zephyrus line is also a good option but that might be a little over your budget."
fdq01u,"Hi, I agree with the other suggestions, the [**Eluktronics MAG-15**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=6xJhMJDSy2I&mid=44583&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fmatte-black-eluktronics-eluktro-pro-x-mag-15-gaming-entertainment%2Fp%2F2WC-000M-00157%3FDescription%3Dmag-15%26cm_re%3Dmag-15-_-9SIA8S1A153169-_-Product%26quicklink%3Dtrue) is a great choice. It comes with a brown switch mechanical keyboard, which are the quieter switches. Reviews say that the keyboard is excellent. The laptop's 6-core i7 processor and GTX 1660 Ti graphics should handle Witcher 3 and other AAA titles extremely well. Battery life is around 7 hours for light use, good enough for school."
fdq01u,"As for the helios, i am currently using one with the 2060 (yeah curse me to hell for not choosing the 1660), and after a little bit of tweakig i get around 6 hours of battery life."
fdq01u,"After different replies saying the same thing (GS65 or Mag - 15) I've been looking into the Mag -15 and it looks amazing, is there any option that I need to get into consideration?"
fdq01u,"I would recommend this [Eluktronics mech g2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R11SWT5/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20)  because it has great combination between value for money, weight, battery life, and performance.

* The outer shell is made almost entirely out of metal.
* Keyboard is mechanical with RGB backlit.
* It has 3 USB type A, Ethernet, and mic and headphone jack and on the back an HDMI, and USB type C.
 
* Screen is IPS with 144Hz refresh rate, with impressively small bezels, and a professional design.
 
* Lid can't be open with one hand.
 
* Fans get loud under intensive work, but that is normal with every good gaming laptop.
 
* Plenty of upgrade options as the chassis supports up to 32GB of ram, and 2 SSDs and 1 HDD.
* Heat management is great, it can get hot but it gets cool again pretty quickly once the fans kick in.
 
* Main con of the laptop is the trackpad, it is mediocre at best when you compare it to other laptops in the price range.
 
* Battery life during normal usage is around 3.5-4.5 hours and 1.5 hour during gaming.
 
* Speakers are down facing so during gaming, it is best to wear headphone since the fan gets loud during gaming as well.

You've got a great budget and not so demanding requirements. I would recommend a business-grade laptop because these are built to last and are very reliable.

One of the most reliable laptops out there is this: [**Dell Precision 15 7540**](https://noteb.com/?model/model.php?conf=7423440777314901418_3401&ex=USD&ref=starchaser) - it has an H series processor, Quadro graphics card, Full HD LED IPS or 4k display, 4 memory slots up to 128 GB RAM, 4 storage interfaces, ~8H battery life or ~6.5H with a 4k display, excellent peripheral port selection: 2 X USB-C 3.1, Thunderbolt, 2 X USB 3.1, 1 X LAN, SD card reader and a  Backlit Chiclet keyboard. You can configure it after your needs and budget on their official site.

Another option could be this one: [**Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Extreme**](https://noteb.com/?model/model.php?conf=3211670729002291123_2997&ex=USD&ref=starchaser) - fewer upgrade options, less powerful specs but it's lighter and it has a better keyboard: Spill-resistant, Backlit Chiclet keyboard. With this coupon: EARLYTHINK you'll get a 45% discount. I don't recommend getting the 4k version for this laptop because it will eat up battery life much faster and if you're getting ~3H you're lucky.

* The display part flexes easily, and the keyboard bends a little if you are hard typer.
* It is very light at 2.5 lbs, it has 2 USB 3, one USB type C, HDMI, and micro SD.
* USB type C doesn't support Thunderbolt 3 or charging and it also doesn't support DisplayPort Alternate mode which means you can't connect external monitors using the port.
* The ram is not upgradeable, so what you buy is what you get, major con if 8 is not enough for your usage.
* Keyboard has four-stage backlight and page Up/Down, Home and End keys don't have their own keys, meaning you would need to use Fn keys to use them, and Key travel is short and feedback is very mushy so it is not the best option if you are used to mechanical keyboard or fast/frequent typer.
 
* Touchpad very accurate and fast as it comes with Microsoft’s Precision, and supports multitouch gestures.
* Touchpad has a glass surface which is very smooth and the buttons are firm.
* Screen doesn't have PWM-flickering (which is a good thing), and it is very bright.
* Color coverage is above average at 93% sRGB and 60.4 RGB.
* High brightness and the matte display makes it great for outside usage.
* Screen is IPS, has great viewing angles.
* Because of how small and light the laptop is, it does throttle under intensive work for long period of time (over 30 mins in intensive work), but in short bursts it works very well.
* Fan gets loud under heavy work, but not to the point where it would be annoying.
* Sound quality is good, but bass is minimal.
* Battery supports quick charge ( a big plus), and Asus claims it can charge up to 60% in less than 50 mins.
* Battery life on average usage had from 7.5 to 9.5 hours.

fc6k64,"Hi, if you want the best possible performance, the MAG-15 isn't a good price. It sacrifices some performance in order to optimize battery life and weight, which aren't important for you. I think that the desktop replacement [**MSI GT76 Titan**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=6xJhMJDSy2I&mid=44583&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fblack-msi-gt76-titan-dt-9sf-230-gaming-entertainment%2Fp%2F2WC-000C-00K50) is a great choice. You get a desktop i7-9700K processor, 32 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, RTX 2070 graphics, and a 1080p 17.3"" 144Hz IPS display. It should handle those games extremely well."
fbuage,"So I don’t know specifics but I can tell you that generally you’ll want an I7 just because they have the higher burst speeds to complete heavy calculations like sims or renders. Now I’m general, CPUs ending in U like an I7 8560U will be a low power variant, so I does 80% of usual CPU things but it doesn’t put out nearly as much heat as an H series so it’s much more comfortable to practically use. Meanwhile H series CPUs are a bit more powerful, but the put out a lot of heat so you need either a loud or big laptop to use one.

Talking GPUs, you want discrete so no integrated graphics, but you don’t need much so you shouldn’t get anything larger than a GTX1650 or RX5500 because that’s starting to get into gaming laptop territory.

So for other system specs, SSDs will he really helpful and you’ll want anything greater than 8gb of RAM.

Putting all of this together, you should look for any laptops with probably an I7 U series CPU with any sort of discrete graphics like MX150 or GTX1650. Then try and get a good amount of RAM. Also remember, the laptop itself has to be comfortable because the user will be using it *a lot*.

Personally I’d look at the MSI Creator laptops like the Prestige 15

Or you can always go the business route and get a Lenovo laptop.

The Yoga has better build quality and better battery life, which are essential to a college student, but it also has less RAM than the HP and its RAM is not upgradeable.

fae24s,"Firstly, it's my general advice that gaming while in battery is something you should never do. It's stutters like crazy. Secondly, I'd say try the tuf series from Asus. It's generally within range and looks cool too. The cpu is capable of handling almost any game, even the relatively new ones. Just a forewarning, don't expect high-end performance from laptops this cheap. They will run most games, but not too well. Cheers."
fae24s,"Forget about 4 years, mx250 won't support current AAA titles. I'd highlysuggest you go for a 1660ti or a 2060 RTX and that's future proof.

1650 for a lower budget. 

To cut down costs for for a Ryzen CPU.

Again I'd suggest getting from the states. You can can get the Acer helios 300 or lenvo 540 for 1000 USD which have really good specs (> 1 lakh INR here)."
fae24s,20k more and you can get yourself an Acer predator 300 with a 1660ti.

fgszsv,Weird. The materials in the screen might be sensitive to the phone's EM radiation when transmitting LTE.
fgszsv,My 2016 15” mbp does this too. But it’s only since my display was replaced some months ago. The original didn’t do that.

fgszsv,"This is EMF from LTE affecting the display bus voltages via induction. 

In this video when you make Instagram ACTIVE, the get / pull request and subsequent stream over lte/ip makes the iPhone emit bursts of EMF as part of network IMSI challenge. When your device pulls for up connectivity, the LTE side band antenna emit RFby way of function. 

In your shown example, the signal hits max amplitude momentarily (the flashing, as you turn off wifi) 

The signal amplitude is visible here due to the peak LTE IP ENQUIRY - FULL DUPLEX from the iPhone chassis, at that range. It oscillates the colours because of the dynamic frequency handling of the iPhone LTE signal amplification across the display bus phi. as well as having its own uniqueness in spec.

Do it too often and you will blow your display diver buffer / io.

It didn’t seem to have any lasting impact, but I didn’t put it back against the screen after that, just to be safe."
fgszsv,"I have a 2018 MacBook Pro 15 inch and a iPhone XS Max (2018)

I always use my MacBook screen as a ""kickstand"" to watch YouTube or something so I was worried and I tried doing this using the same method you did.  I turned off wifi from control center and then I went to Instagram and refreshed it.  Nothing happened to my MacBook screen.  Maybe something to do with the difference in bands between your iPhone model and mine?  We both seem to have the same MacBook- 15 inch!"
fgszsv,Someone literally posted about this yesterday or the day before.
fgszsv,"The iPhone has a transmitter at the bottom of the phone and your MacBook has its video ribbon cable at the base of the screen.  The screen blocks some of the signal from your phone and causes it to transmit at a higher power — which in turn is adsorbed right into your ribbon cable.  I know it looks like a fun effect, but you shouldn’t do this.  Maximum transmit is around 24dBm — which is pretty low but this can add noise on the power and data lines and they really aren’t built with that in mind."
fgszsv,All I saw wast instagram opening a a computer having a seizure and now I’m sure that Redit is better
fgszsv,My 2015 MBP’s screen shuts black whenever I hover my Android phone over it. Doesn’t happen with my iPhone though. I just tell my friends my MBP is allergic to androids and can’t be near them haha
fgszsv,Happened to me with my iPhone 11 and MacBook Pro
fgszsv,"This happens on my 2016 15in MBP, and my phone doesn’t have to be touching it for that to happen lol"
fgszsv,"Yeah, same happens on my MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018)."
fgszsv,It doesn’t like instagram.
fgszsv,I have the same macbook pro but it doesnt glitch with my iPhone X
fgszsv,"This doesn’t exactly relate but when I used to put my iPhone XR near a windows laptop’s trackpad, the iPhone would actually lock itself. I think ur experiencing something similar but it’s opposite."
fgszsv,"Tried it on my 15"" 2019, didn't do anything. Probably depends on the specific phone and frequency of LTE used."
fgszsv,Really crazy just how advanced we are and how much things interact with each other on such a small level. On a different note I had a wifi adapter in my computer that was kind of janky so whenever I was listening to any sort of audio through my motherboards IO and started using the internet I could hear really bad static interference. I am positive it was linked because it would get really bad when I ran a speed test.
fgszsv,I think you almost summoned the devil
fgszsv,"As I've used my MBP LCD as a prop up for my iPhone, my 2015 13"" never did this."
fgszsv,"Yeah this has happened to me before, really thought I was the only one"
fgszsv,"yes, this has happened to me before when i propped my phone against my laptop to film something. it wasn’t a whole “thing” it just did the pink glitchy thing for a second or so and then stopped. probably nothing to worry about, but i’m no tech expert  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
fgszsv,"Just me thinking, this could be an interesting way to see how often a phone connects/receives/sends data, that’s just my opinion though, it probably wouldn’t be reliable"
fgszsv,Same think scared me a lot
fgszsv,Wireless charger?
fgszsv,The power of the eldrich tech gods is consuming your macbook
fgszsv,"Yeah I've had this, obviously it startled me too..."
fgszsv,I’ve not seen this but  I can hear noise thru the speakers of my work desktop when I send or am about to receive a message. Background app refresh does it too.
fgszsv,"WTF, THIS HAPPENS TO ME ALL THE TJME I THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY. I thought maybe it was just my screen bending in a slightly bad way? 

On a real note, I don’t think it’s worrying. I put my phone on my screen a lot when I’m FaceTiming my girlfriend while doing homework, and even this rarely happens and never stays long."
fgszsv,This happens all time the time around my 16” MB Pro with my iPhone XS. Not too worried about it but I try to keep my phone off the screen
fgszsv,Just don't put your phone near your pc lol
fgszsv,Yep this happened to me too.
fgszsv,"I think it’s more so the pressure from the phone on the screen. I’ve had my MacBook Pro break from this exact thing.

If you continue to place the phone on that region it will get worse over time and will eventually begin malfunctioning on its own. Then at some point the display will stop working entirely.

I could be wrong but I’ve seen this before. My recommendation would be to stop."
fgszsv,Why is your phone there in the first place?
fgszsv,Elon Musk is hacking you
fgszsv,"Just ... don’t. Why would you do that, this is  interference, like they said, they won’t shield up every pice inside."
fgszsv,Something to do with magnetism I’m sure
fgszsv,This happens to me
fgszsv,Does the phone have a wireless charging coil in it?
fgszsv,"Why would anyone put their phone there?  Don’t worry about it, just stop doing stupid things..."
fgszsv,will try on my late 2019 later on
fgszsv,Yes! This has happened a few times. Recorded it for Apple at one point and last time (Feb) they said a patch is on its way. So far it hasn’t happened since then but my phone was always close by if not beside it...so strange.
fgszsv,"I have a 2016, og screen didn't have problems. Had it replaced, it started to happen--only after i took my phone out of my giant otterbox case. I brought this up when i was getting some service a few months ago genius bar said it was totally normal. Makes sense to me."
fgszsv,Wac.
fgszsv,Photoshop
fgszsv,Interference
fgszsv,Yes me!!!!!!
fgszsv,You are now entering the matrix
fgszsv,"I had the same problem a few months ago. I was going to take it into an Apple Store, but I couldn’t consistently recreate the issue."
fgszsv,Why would you even do that?
fgszsv,So...don't do that? Why would you need to do that in the first place. Probably has to do with whatever the phone is emitting.
fgszsv,Idk anyone who puts their phone directly onto their computer screen.
fgszsv,What the
fgszsv,I has this issue
fgszsv,Hmmm... Maybe try... not... doing that?
fgszsv,"Weird. I have a Samsung S9 on Sprint and I put my phone up against my mid 2012 15"" mbp screen to read off when I'm typing. This has never happened to me, but I also have never out it right in the center. I place it on the edge of the screen."
fgszsv,Oh weird. Does it on my 2019 MBP
fgszsv,Don’t put your phone on the screen like that? It can’t be good for the hinge or display anyway. That’s a surefire to scratch your screen.
fgszsv,I don’t think Apple would think about putting an iPhone up to the screen...
fgszsv,"Yes happens with 2017 Macbook pro, 2015 Macbook pro!"
fgszsv,I’m pretty sure that’s what happens in my head when I talk on the phone too.
fgszsv,"In all my years using a MacBook, it has never occurred to me once to lean my phone directly against the screen. Who does that?"
fgszsv,"Wow.  You realize radio signals are coming out of the phone, right?  Through the circuits in the screen?  

The bigger question is what these signals do to the cells in our body."
fgszsv,Whaaaaaaaaaa!?! That looks kinda cool though not gonna lie
fgszsv,"I had a similar experience. However, my screen died completely for couple of days then revived spontaneously while looking for a repair shop."
fgszsv,Makes me wonder about putting the phone near my head.  8-(
fgszsv,"Simple, don’t put your phone there. 

Look at the bigger screen that is on your Mac."
fgszsv,Frequency.
fgszsv,I’ve also heard that it does weird stuff underwater.
fgszsv,I don’t wanna be pain in the ass but please stop pushing the damn Pro screen when you touching you phone
fgszsv,"Hmm i have no clue but my first (probably SUPER bad) guess is the lte is making the wires connecting the screen to the bottom half of the laptop are acting like the aerial on a radio and the signal is making them go haywire? Not even a shred of experience so I could be WAY off lmao, hope it’s an easy fix!"

ffpzks,"These machines can sometimes get slow for odd reasons. For example, there’s sensor in the trackpad cable that can fail and convince the machine that it is overheating, so it will go super slow and run the fans at full speed. Not saying that’s necessarily what’s happening here, but the point is it might not be an obvious issue. The battery can also cause issues if it has failed. 

Maybe try booting into safe mode and see how it performs."
ffpzks,More info - I actually haven't been home in 2 years so it's been turned off for a long time. I've upgraded the OS to High Sierra because I read that's the last OS that 2011 Macbook can use. I've used some youtube (lol I know nothing) tutorials to clean the cache. I've also freed up 170Gb of space. It's still running sooo slow though.
ffpzks,"It's intentional. When there is a task using too much computer resource and cause the temperature rising, `kernel_task` will proactively take large amount of CPU time, to force that tasks to release resources and prevent it from overheating your computer. When the overheating situation is resolved, `kernel_task` will drop to normal. So `kernel_task` is the result, not the cause."

If it has an SSD already, then there is some other serious problem going on.

Also the RAM can be upgraded but it's a massive project to get at the RAM in that model."

fe4bzp,"I'm gonna start right now and tell you that you can't throw EU laws at companies after owning their product for 3 years and you're just telling them of an issue. Firstly a cracked screen is the fault of the consumer. I'm not trying to frustrate you but at the end of the day you weren't sold a cracked screen otherwise you would've brought this up to Apple the moment you took it out of the box. EU laws are to protect consumers from an actual defect and the burden of proof is on the consumer that there IS an actual defect. Secondly you have to bring it up within a reasonable time frame. Many consumer laws I've read require the consumer to bring up an issue within the first 6 months of ownership. Then a repair needs to be performed by Apple or authorized Apple service center and the issue must be documented. If you the consumer continues to have the same problem then EU law may be on your side up to 2 years. 

EU laws are not extended warranties and they do not cover physical damage. Please don't be offended but based on your post you've taken zero responsibility about the screen damage and you've had this machine for 3 years. You can't blame Apple over this. 

You can get your keyboard replaced since it's still under the 4 year repair program but your screen damage has nothing to do with the display cable issue."

As most computers can’t be upgraded and over time programs will need more ram then a better cpu. If you can find a refurb that has both ram and cpu get that as it’ll be cheaper and you might be able to find some more storage as well for 3000"

I’d say go for it. The late 2013 15” is very reliable and they’re also identical to the mid-2014 models. So Apple would be ditching all pre-2015 MacBook pros if they were to ditch the 2013’s which they aren’t likely to do for some time"
fcurio,"Depends on the price of course, but a machine with 16 GB RAM and an SSD is still a nice performer. I'd say it's a very good option for someone on a budget.

I still use a 2013 iMac as my primary computer, and a 2009 MBP as my secondary/portable one."
fcurio,"I’m in a similar situation as you. I’m looking to get a new Mac for work and I’m looking at 2012-2015 models or the new 16” 2019 model. I looked at different time periods and broke it down like this:

1.	A well taken care of, high spec model from 2012 (non-retina) runs you around $550. The most powerful model gets GB4 scores of 3,594/12,035. This breaks down to a performance/price ratio of 6.53/21.88
2.	A well taken care of, high spec model from 2015 can run you up to $950. The most powerful model gets GB4 scores of 4,363/14,533, which breaks down to performance/price 4.59/15.297.
3.	Barely used and sometimes new base model 16” can be found for around $1850. The base model gets gets scores of 5,235/23,764, which goes performance/price scores of 2.83/12.845

These scores only reflect CPU performance only, however. If GPU and SSD speed are important you’ll want to give more consideration to newer models. This really just shows that as far as best value goes, the 2012’s are great, parts are way to find and replace. Additionally, plenty of people on egpu.io share builds using TB3 eGPUs on the 2012 MBP, so that’s also a possibility."
fcurio,"OP, there's two different versions of these MBPs, one with an iGPU and another with the iGPU and a dGPU. I own one of the latter, and it's in like-new condition - and it's not my main Mac, I use it solely for CUDA needs. Neither version has received GPU driver updates in over 3 years on macOS. Also, some of these units have/had LG displays - look very closely for spotting or peeling; mine has a Samsung display.

And, in an Admin user account, review the Crash logs for KPs related to possible memory failures - the motherboard is glued in and all elements are soldered, a $600-$900 repair; my unit had a memory failure in 2015 but was covered under AppleCare and a few of them in the engineering firm I own also had the same issue and repair - one day they worked, then KPs randomly started.

IMO these units will get at least one more OS update at a minimum, they can handle Metal - for now. The lack of GPU updates gives me the feeling that the end of support for Macs with NVIDIA dGPUs is nigh, and the older Intel iGPUs have been cut off for some time.

I'll be selling my rMBP later this year unless I just get lowballed. Then I'll just install Win10 Pro on it - at least MS and Intel and NVIDIA are still supporting the GPUs in my Mac.

Lots of rumors abound with upcoming rMBP updates - which means big cuts for existing Mac laptops. This is what I'm waiting for..."

fceva0,"Your concerns are completely valid. Using the password reset command in terminal will absolutely invalidate the keychain. The command will reset the login / user password, but it won’t reset the keychain password. The only way to reset the keychain password is with the old password. 

In other words, resetting the password breaks the keychain. 

Are there multiple Users / User Accounts on the Mac? If he knows his account password, but he is not an admin. Then you might be ok. Resetting one account password, won’t effect another account or it’s keychain. Carefully reset the admin account password. 

If he does not know his account password, and the computer is auto-logging in when he turns it on, then you are screwed, in terms of saving the keychain. 

If you are unsure about all that, ask him: When he turns the computer on, does he have to type in a password? If he does, then there are 2 accounts, he is not an admin, and you can reset the admin password. If he doesn’t, then it is auto-logging in, and you have a lot of work to do.

fbfdou,I really hope they don’t add touchscreen to it. I’ve never liked them on laptops.. had one once and it took a very minor fall and the touch stopped working and couldn’t use the screen at all. It went crazy rendering the laptop useless. Not to mention all the finger prints
fbfdou,"I doubt touch support.  Fingers are fat and imprecise. You need a drastically different UI for that. That is what iOS accomplishes.

I could easily see pencil support though. If that happens, I would expect it to be called a different product.

What were already seeing instead is Mac features getting ported to iOS.

I think the iPad Pro will replace the air in time."
fbfdou,"After using a surface at work for years now, the main benefit of it concerning the touch screen is it can be folded flat. With the kick stand propping it up, the touch screen is much harder to use. 

That is a long way of saying the iPad works with the keyboard because it can be turned to be flat on your lap and easier to use that way. 

So imho the Mac will get a touch screen as soon as Apple can thing of an innovative way to make it flat.   I don’t feel the Lenovo Yoga approach is necessarily a good one, as the keyboard lays exposed and it’s twice as thick as it needs to be. 

So I would say at some point it will, but not until Apple can solve that little problem."
fbfdou,Mac OS and iPad OS are two completely different interfaces that compliments their respective input. Trying to add mouse support to an os that is best with touch is clumsy design in most scenarios. Trying to add touchscreen to a desktop os would render a redesign that would lead to a half assed mid life crisis mess that is Windows 8/10.

Like me (and I’m no genius or expert) you could, quite easily upgrade the drive capacity.  And or, possibly swap out the optical media for a second drive, that is if you may need more storage. Or perhaps max the ram. Quite inexpensive if one shops around and there are numerous sites that will help. 

If you want to identify the mac you own click on the apple icon in the left corner of you desktop, click, “about this mac”, it’ll give you the model and memory.   I hope this helps it’s far less expensive than a whole machine upgrade and should keep you ticking along until you get that iMac"

As for the power disparity, a 2015 MBP 15"" is built more for performance than thrifty battery consumption. I have one, so I sympathize. When I run battery out in the world, I usually step down to a MacBook Air. But, if the MBP is the right or the available choice, run with the screen dimmed as far as you can stand, don't plug in any external monitors (it'll fire up the M370X GPU, if so equipped and you'll lose another 45W or so), and only have graphics-intensive apps active for the time that you need them (same thing to avoid the GPU).

Then, if your S/T does show your brand of SSD inside, find a few other retailers close-by and ask them to tell you the S/Ts of a few of the same models they have in stock. Plug in their S/Ts on the Dell website, and see if you can find one with a faster SSD.

Or, speak to Dell, etc."

Were any recent hardware, software changes or updates performed on the system before the issue occurred?
Does the issue occur while playing other games?

fdneoh,"Why not just clone the essential parts of the HDD onto the ssd?  You can buy a USB m.2 box from amazon for well under $20.  ssd clone really really fast, like 500GB in 40 minutes, IIRC."
fdneoh,"I have the same machine.

I did something a little different.  I bought two SSD drives.  The first, a 1 TB M.2 SSD drive and the second, a 2 TB 2.5 SSD drive.

I was wanting to install linux on this machine but keep Windows 10 should I ever need to use it again.  I took out the 1 TB HDD and installed the two SSD drives.

It's a weird scenario though.  The drive I wanted to boot from (the M.2 1 TB SSD) is seen as SATA 1 and the other drive I want to use for data (the 2.5 2 TB SSD) is seen as SATA 0.  

Opposite of what I wanted.

I wrote to Dell.  They said that it was working as it should?

Really?  Give me a break.  There's no way in the BIOS to say which SSD drive is SATA 0 or SATA1.

Fortunately, linux doesn't care which is which and I have it working on this machine just fine.  I also replaced the RAM and am running now with 32 GB of RAM installed.  

I wrote to Dell and asked them if I could install 32 GB of RAM?  They said that they only support 16 GB of RAM on this machine.  I had only one of the DIMM bays populated.  It seemed logical that adding another DIMM would work.  I took a gamble, rolled the dice and it's working very well.

One thing I had to do in order to do this was disable secure boot and UEFI and enable legacy boot to make sure that I could use a USB drive or DVD for installation.  

I'm not sure if you would need to do that or not?  It's something to look at in the BIOS though and may enable you to do what you want to do?

Good luck."

This is Deepti from Dell Reddit Support.
Firstly, ensure BIOS & Video Driver is up to date-

•	Check for Dell Premier Color App & Check if it is set to sRGB.

•	Then ensure display default color profile is set to “Premier Color Adobe sRGB 6500”. If it is not available you need to add the same & set it to default.

•	Open the Intel control Panel, Change the color gamut setting to natural colors if it is not available then follow the below step

•	Open regedit enable wide gamut (Change the value to 1 to enable)

•	Open the Intel control Panel, Change the color gamut setting to natural colors

fblipf,Yeah that's what happens with mine too. I believe in the same spot too. Can't really do much about it tbh.
fblipf,"If you look on the screw you will likely see a bit of residual blue substance on it. 

This is medium strength removable thread lock that is applied to the screws at the time the laptop is built. It's just probably not had quite enough added to that screw. 

If you buy some and add a small amount to any of the screws that are loose or falling out you will be all sorted. You just need to make sure you get the correct strength and colour (Medium/Removable Blue) and you'll be set.

The attached pic shows the different types of thread lock you can get (Obviously you can get different brands as well which potentially may be different colour!/?).

Thank you for reaching the Dell Reddit Support. This is Deepti and I will be assisting you.

Please confirm if the system heats up or freezes before shutting down. Also, share the service tag on private message- http://dell.to/2z6cXm8

Does it happen on all the games you play?

Let’s run the hardware diagnostics to understand if there is any hardware failure in the system. 
To do so:
1)	Restart the system.
2)	Keep tapping F12 key when the Dell logo appears during the startup.
3)	Select diagnostics from the one-time boot menu and run the initial test.
4)	Once done, do let me know if you receive any error code and validation code.

You can skip the extended memory test.

For my 9570, I did a host of heat-removal physical mods that get my typical operating temp around 40C.  Repasting, bridging the vrms to the heatsink/case, some tricky cutting of copper, and better channeling of air.

I also ripped out the Killer WiFi card and replaced with an Intel AC9260.

For software, I was very happy with Linux (OpenSUSE) and undervolt in systemd mode.  However because I have to use this workstation frequently for work, and my work requires a number of Windows-only packages, I just gave up and moved back to W10.

Under W10 I run Throttlestop as a service.  I have found it rock solid and easier to use than XTU but that's just me.

First off, I like the XPS. If you never have any chance of spilling a drink on it, use it to plug into modern equipment like a TV or wired mouse, or want to get inside of it without stripping out a soft screw head, then this is perfect. I’m being serious when I say this, but this is perfect for the executive that travels often and doesn’t need to present in a meeting room. 

My wishes are mainly hardware. 

1- Install a membrane under the keyboard to prevent accidental liquid spills. One of our end users found out the hard way that the XPS laptops offer nothing to protect from liquid. Shame. It is because of this I won’t buy another XPS again. It’s simply not ready for prime time Enterprise but Dell sure does flaunt them like they are. 

2- Redesign the hinge so the display opens to a much higher degree. It’s just a matter of time until I accidentally break it because I’m tall. 

3- For the love of all that is tech, GIVE US BACK A HDD ACTIVITY LIGHT! Sadly, the user manual references the ability to turn the battery status light into a HDD light. When I read this I was peeing my pants with excitement. After a few weeks of being engaged with Dell Pro Support (stellar group BTW, really), they determined this was not actually included as a feature and was in the manual by mistake. Sad day. 

4- Give us at least one USB-A port. I get it - USB-C is here to stay. But dangit there are still so many devices that have USB-A and I have to carry around an adapter to use them. Reminds me of being in the middle of IDE and PCI, or PCI and PCIe. 

5- HDMI port is much needed. Seriously. The lack of this is yet another adapter I have to keep with me when it should just be built in. The Lenovo X1 Carbon has one; come on Dell. 

6- Standard Phillips screws, and make them more durable. Who does Dell think they are putting Torx screws all on the outside of their case; Apple?

7- Eraser head pointer device ...aww just kidding. Those suck so bad!"
f9b54l,Just had to do this for my 7390 2 in 1. Intel Graphics settings & disable screen power saving. This makes it so the built in dynamic brightness does not get brighter on lighter screens/darker on darker screens. Really annoying.

f9b54l,"Install Linux, if you're absolutely new to Linux, then probably your best option is Ubuntu. My experience with the XPS improved so much when I quit Windows for good. You know those fan problems everyone complains about? None of them in Linux, just silence. Startup time is so fast (although Windows startup was fast too). Only drawback I've found is the battery, it lasts less, that you have to recognize it to Windows. However installing Linux is like unlocking the full potential of your XPS.

Oh and of course get rid of the killer wifi card, get an intel one. And you can always buy an XPS with 128gb SSD and upgrade it yourself to whatever you might need (970 pro is so good), it's always cheaper this way."

Excuse my ignorance, but why are you disappointed with the glossy finish vs the matte finish? I've always preferred matte because I can see the screen basically anywhere I go, even if glare is bad. Do you do graphic-intensive stuff that would make you prefer glossy, or is there another reason?

The solution is first, to use pnputil in CMD to remove traces of the driver (do a list of all drivers first before attempting to remove) and then reinstall it manually (search online -- there is a specific folder to look for). Otherwise you have to do a system reset. Had this issue previously on a Lenovo.

Btw are you able to share the SSD on this model?"

f723qe,"Did you go with an OEM battery for the replacement? Reason I ask is I have an XPS 15 9550 which also suffered from a failed battery. I have since replaced the battery twice, both with non-OEM batteries from Amazon. I've noticed that if I leave my laptop powered off for a few days, when I go to power it back on, the power light glows for a few seconds, but the laptop never turns on. The charging status light on the front also flashes Amber twice. 

The only way I can get it to turn back on is to leave it plugged in and charging for about 30 minutes. Even then, when it does turn on I get an error saying ""no boot device found"". I have to then go into the BIOS and reconfigure the boot devices.  It will work normally until I leave it for a few days. Then, same issue. 

Does the front charging LED blink at all? If it does keep note of the number of blinks as you can determine the cause of the problem.

f3hl9k,"  Try UncleWebb’s advice here; it lifted my power limit throttle:

http://forum.notebookreview.com/threads/how-to-interpet-pl1-and-various-other-limits-i7-8750h.828673/

This fixed the same problem for my G3 3590"
f3hl9k,"You hit thermal limits and you won't get any more performance unless you can lower the temp. When the processor is at thermal limits you actually loose more performance than you gain because the processor will drop the multiplier lower to compensate. You want to reduce the 4 active core multiplier by 1. Or look into different thermal paste, but in my experience it won't lower temps much unless it was a bad install. (changing edp/power limit throttle won't help anything when you are already throttled by thermals)"
f3hl9k,"I highly recomend that you don’t use it like this, look at your temps, they’re very high, its better to keep it cool... in order to do that i limit my cpu clock under FIVR options, look for the turbo clock, then you just need to adjust the right clock for you"
f3hl9k,"If you haven't solved this problem yet here's some advice from a fellow G7 7588 user:

1. Turn BD PROCHOT off, it's not necessary and will only limit your cpu, you're not overclocking and the i7 8750H's temp limit is set much lower than it's actually capable of, do some googling about ***undervolting*** if you don't believe me. (not overclocking, you don't want to overclock.
2. If you're up for the task, you can try ***repasting*** your cpu. I personally just did this, used Arctic MX4 thermal compound, you only need the 2g one. I messed up the first repaste and my temps were skyrocketing. DO NOT spread the paste like butter on bread on the cpu die, it'll create air pockets in-between the heatsink and  the cpu die, instead of acting as a conductor for heat the air will act as an insulator. Instead use the rice method. Don't worry, too much is better than too little, it's been shown that an ""over pasted"" cpu performs within margin of error of a normally pasted one. Again, google how to repaste, in this case I recommend **Linus Tech Tips**.
   1. Quick side note, if you've had your laptop for a while its also a good idea to clean the heatsink radiators! The second time around I noticed a ton of dust build up in-between the fan and the radiator fins.
3. ***Learn how to undervolt***, its not hard, the two main tabs you'll be using are FIVR and TPL, again google this and learn it, I can tell you how to do as much as you want but if you don't understand what it does, you'll mess up and you won't know why, and I won't know why and we'll be sad pandas.

I personally had the following settings before repasting:

CPU undervolt -125mv, CPU Cache Undervolt -125mv, Turbo Boost Power limits 20w power max , 25w short power max, I also changed my turbo ratio limits to 34x 2 core active, 32x 4 core active, 30x 6 core active (when the cpu runs full throttle it would average at these values).

**IMPORTANT**, in the bottom right of the FIVR control screen you'll see three options, the one YOU want so you don't brick your computer and Blue Screen of Death (**BSOD**) is **""DO NOT SAVE VOLTAGES""**, this ensures that if you do blue screen, you can **restart** your computer and it wont blue screen again because you undervolted too far and permanently saved your settings. (SORRY EDIT: my settings are on save voltages immediately, that is false, you want do not so you can keep testing)

Undervolting is a process, certain chips are capable of undervolting further than others, even if they're technically the same exact chip in name.

Hope this helps."

f37nk3,"*Welcome to Dell Support. Have you tried turning it on or off again?*

Now, have you checked the display is connected properly to your motherboard? In your service manual on [Dell.com](https://Dell.com), there should be a guide to allow you to get access underneath the panelling. Make sure your laptop is off and removed from any power source before making changes to components (take both the power plug and battery out).

After that, simply unplugging and plugging that cable back in, as well as firmly testing it does not move (be gentle, a screen can cost >$200)."

Based on the timelines, this has likely been impacted by the nCoV situation in China. Dell and other OEMs have key suppliers there without which a full blown launch can mean shooting themselves in the foot if they can't support it. The delayed launch should bide them time to either tap into other suppliers or wait for the current suppliers to get cleared."

So I guess it's possible your board has an older version, but unlikely. Maybe if you got it used, or one that was on the shelf for a long time. Also, I would think that an older chip like a 2700x should at least post on an older BIOS but might not work optimally. Seems odd to me that it would not be support from the start."

I did a little bit of research beforehand and got the representative to admit that the replacement parts they send back are units that have failed and been ""repaired"" so that would also explain why their RMA process normally isn't over after the customer's first time.

Finally got tired of their bullshit so I got an MSI 2070 Super and have had 0 problems with anything at all unless it's an issue with the specific game or coil whine (possibly due to my PSU) which is honestly the least of my worries as of now.

Moral of the story is that yes, Asus makes some great products and I give it to them for being one of the best brands up until recently as it seems, but just pray that you don't need to send anything in for repairs because it's been an absolute nightmare for me and others."

ffqqx5,"X1 Carbon 6th Gen, in the middle of testing 7th Gen and X1E1. T470/T480 also confirmed working, and should work on at least all Skylake and related (14nm++++++) platforms.

There are WAY more options in the Adv Menu on Skylake compared to the older Ivybridge.

And the OC settings are nearly complete. RAM timings, voltage, etc. Only thing we can't change is the maximum multipliers on the CPUs. Those are unfortunately fused, so no going above the stock limits :(

TPM has the same ""MFG Mode"" issue as with 1vyrain, but functions, including with Bitlocker.

THIS IS A HARDWARE FLASH, NOT software. We are investigating software methods.

The big takeaway here is that Boot Guard has been successfully bypassed on (all?) recent ThinkPads and the stock BIOS has been blown open for further patching. Skylake Coreboot soon?

I can't take credit for any of these recent discoveries. While 1vyrain may have been the inspiration, skyra1n was only automated and coined by me. The hard work was done by paranoidbashthot (discovering test mode and Boot Guard bypass) and \\x (BIOS patching) of the Thinkpad discord."

fg8oxh,"Hi fellow x60 user. I am too using an ThinkPad x60. I got a few tips: for general usage, I think running some lighter flavor of Linux is better than Windows. For example, Ubuntu MATE, Xubuntu or Lubuntu. Secondly, you can upgrade the RAM up to   4GB. But due to the chipset limitation of the X60 only 3GB will be visible as usable in OS. The rest should be used for iGPU or other system devices but I'm not sure if this is 100% true. You can also watch YouTube videos pretty well in VLC - just drag and drop the video to the VLC window and that's it - videos should be a lot more smoother with less CPU usage and heat dissipation.
I'm using my x60 like this without much problems for basic web browsing, watching YT and such, creating documents etc... But to be completely honest, browsing the web will always be kind of difficult with it, as todays web is just bloated piece of garbage."
fg8oxh,"You may find that your machine will not boot with 2x2GB RAM sticks installed, limiting you to 3GB total. This was the case with my R60e. It would not boot in that configuration at all."
fg8oxh,"I run an X300 in dual boot W7/Lubuntu which is similar to your X60. Brave browser was the best I could find for this hardware/os platform, I don't think there is much more you can do with it. The X60/61 may not have had soldered processors so you could maybe upgrade it but 3GB is the RAM max."
fg8oxh,"You can put in up to 4GB of RAM. Linux may help, but I would suggest a distro with a light desktop environment like Xubuntu. The CPU is 32-bit though, which is going to limit you more and more as time goes on."
ffrhg6,That is the lamest looking keyboard ever laid on a thinkpad
ffrhg6,WHERES THE CLIT
ffrhg6,free the nipple
ffrhg6,No trackpoint => Not a thinkpad.

ffrhg6,No trackpoint?
ffrhg6,This is cool I guess but where's the trackpoint?
ffrhg6,"Nice, you get a screen smaller than a normal laptop when using on your lap and a screen probably smaller than 21.5"" when using on a desk. All of this probably paying more than a laptop + 24"" FHD screen while having a crappy keyboard + touchpad and having to deal with setting Windows mode every time you change the screen usage."
ffrhg6,I'll give the screen two weeks in the real world.
ffrhg6,"All this folding display stuff feels like material science innovation happened and UI/UX design followed uninspired, not the other way around.

The fundamental problem is, a keyboard with haptic feedback still is the most efficient output interface to the human brain, as it utilizes the highly capable human hand the fullest; for the highest bandwidth input interface, the visual system, innovation is stuck with 2D screens and folding them isn't adding anything substantial.

Until 3D visual interfaces or tapping directly into the brain/neuronal transmission become mainstream and universal, everything will remain pretty, maybe niche, at best.  

Side note: Finding the useful niche, I wouldn't bet on Lenovo, Samsung or Google, but Apple still."

fg320j,"We have a 3d printer at work that prints with chopped carbon in the plastic...I forget which plastic, but it's damned impressive stuff. It doesn't do that awful warped mess that you get with PLA. If you can do something like that I'd wager it's worth a shot. Of course, it's going to take two or more days to print (the first time) and you probably will need more than one try, and with chopped carbon fiber it won't be clear.

So probably not worth it?"

Basically from a coding point of view fine and even with something like Unity or Unreal you can do a fair amount with that machine.  But the HD5500 graphics will be a stumbling point.  

&#x200B;

Web dev fine, android development will be fine for the most park, and the others.  Keep in mind if your starting from scratch, and it will take you some time before it gets to a complex point, and therefore saying the laptop will be fine for starting out and then get something more down the line.  You could look at a W541, or a P50... yes workstation GPU's and a true quad core cpu, might be a better route...but you will lose battery life and they are heavier."

Yes, it won't be the super fancy Lenovo image - but then again on the upside it won't be the Lenovo image with all the bloatware.  :)

Sorry this doesn't answer the original question, but it is super easy to do this and thinkpads are amazingly well supported in windows so you should find it a smooth ride."

My daughter help me customize it with the Harry Potter sticker ;). I was wanting to get some ideas on how to upgrade it.

The current specs are the following.

CPU: Intel i7-4600M

Memory: 16GB

GPU: GeForce GT 730M

Screen: 1920x1080 TN

Storage: 256 GB SSD

I put a small SSD in it when I got it (256 GB) and just recently upgraded the RAM from 8 to 16 GB. I am a Linux user and do not really plan on running Windows ever on it. I have a known good i7-4810mq and I also just received a busted Dell Precision m4800 that has an i7-4910mq. I pulled the RAM out of the m4800 and that is what I used to upgrade the RAM. I do not know if the CPU is good as the machine won't power on. I don't know how the thermals will be if I upgarde to the quad core from the dual core i7. The TN display is ok, but I feel it is lack luster sometimes.

I want to upgrade the CPU and screen, but not sure what to look out for. Also if there is any other easy mods to increase my quality of life on this sweet machine, I would greatly appreciate suggestions."
ff4uqj,Have you considered putting Coreboot on it?
ff4uqj,What's with all the ram usage?
fexkpt,Gaming is not really why people buy thinkpads.
fexkpt,"Rainbow Six as in the 1998 Rainbow Six, or one of the newer titles? The '98 original oughta' run on anything these days.

With Thinkpads, really your options are...

1. Buy a Thinkpad with a discrete GPU and settle for what it can run
2. Buy an older Thinkpad with express card slot and run an external GPU
3. Buy a newer Thinkpad with a Thunderbolt slot and run an external GPU
4. Buy a desktop to supplement your Thinkpad VIA something like Steam link

Right now I have a Thinkpad T440p with the NVidia card and it does most of what I want. Older titles are no sweat, I can actually run SOME newer titles like GTA V, but many newer games won't run since I only have 1GB of VRAM. For this reason I'm looking into buying one of the SFF Thinkcentres, tossing in a graphics card and setting up Steam link.

If you don't mind a 15 inch form factor, the W540 and W541, I believe, have 2GB of VRAM and also have an express card slot, so if you can find one of those for a good price that may be the best of both."
fexkpt,You can get a good thinkpad for under 500 but you won’t be able to game. Most thinkpad only have Intel Graphics. You will need a X1 Extreme but that is $1300+. So...
fexkpt,"Although Lenovo makes gaming laptops (their Legion line), the ThinkPad line is more for getting work done. The thing is, you can turn your laptop into a gaming laptop with an egpu. Your budget is actually not bad for getting a decent used thinkpad (look into the T line). If portability is very important to you, you can't go wrong with the X line. But it's generally more expensive than the T line so the value per dollar is slightly less here.

Save up and then you can get an external graphic card later to game on your laptop using the thunderbolt 3 connection (make sure the laptop you're getting has this connection, most modern computers do). 

In my opinion, the discrete graphic cards are quite mediocre in ThinkPads when it comes to *gaming*. They're more optimized for CAD and other work related tasks."
fexz0n,"Fedora 31 works great on my X395 since kernel 5.5. You'll need to do a full system update after install.

Ubuntu 20.04 should also work for you, I think. It's in beta for another month, but it should have the latest kernel and stuff that you need.

In general: More up-to-date software is more better for laptops that aren't very old and/or come with new technology (Ryzen).

Also, bit of advice: Stick to the big distros. Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, openSUSE. They are much much much much better tested and more widely used than the likes of Mint and Manjaro."

feyuz6,"Do you use external monitor/s? If yes, then should keep in mind the external monitors are hard wired through the dGpu so you will have no choice but to have the nvidia enabled all the time.... and if that's the case it's maybe better to get something with just iGpu instead..

I really doubt that a) the insurance company would cover this cost, unless you have it insured as a business vehicle, b) the insurance company would not question why you had so many ThinkPads and would dig into seeing if you and the other driver had ever had contact or a relationship before

but if it's real and if you get the payout - man good on you"

fdtv56,"Both my T420 and X1E2 are similar in this regard (the latter drifts slightly less): the trackpoint starts to drift whenever I use it non-stop for a prolonged time period. If I let it go, it sorts itself out in about 5-7 seconds."
fdtv56,"Trackpoint drift is a widespread problem for Thinkpad owners, especially among Carbon X1 owners.  It's also an issue that Lenovo has conveniently swept under the rug by refusing to acknowledge to assist. 

The drift can range from barely noticeable while being still controllable by the user to extreme drift where the cursor is not only uncontrollable, but also invisible because it's pinned to the edge of the screen.  

So the bottomline here is a little bit of drift is normal.  If it interrupts your work flow, then it's a problem.  Look here and the Lenovo support community forum for assistance if you need help."

faz1q4,"You ripped the connectors clean off without damaging the contacts on the boards, which is good, since it allows for easy resoldering.

The resoldering you can't avoid; it's also unlikely that there's a cheaper way.

If you have no solid soldering experience, this is tricky to do yourself (though it can be done).

For someone with soldering experience it's not all that hard; the technique to do this easily is called ""drag soldering"" (feel free to look it up on youtube), which requires a decent soldering iron with good thermal performance, a good amount of flux and a steady hand.

Since you have no solid soldering experience, its probably better you bring it to a decent repair shop. If they do good work, it should only take a couple of minutes (though it might be wise to remove the board from the chassis), and not cost too much money.

If you can get the board out safely yourself, any good repair shop should be able to do that in 5 minutes without any spare parts.

I very much don't see a reason to replace the board, this looks like a really easy fix. Instead of a shop, if you have a friend who has some PCB soldering experience, they will certainly be able to fix it for a 6-pack, so don't feel too bad.


Edit: In case you haven't figured it out yet (sine the connectors are still attached to the cables on your pics): you have to lift the black plastics part up to pull the ZIF connector out :)"

fd3vki,"Hope that helps.

It probably will since i own the same model."
fd3vki,"How does your Mom use the laptop? Does she use it on a table? Bed?

How is the room temperature? Laptop's idle temperature?

The Helios 300 has a single heat sink that connects both GPU and CPU. If any of them get overheated, it will throttle. Make sure you're not using it on Bed and if possible, Try elevating the back of the laptop in a way that air can pass through the underside of the laptop. It shouldn't heat up too much.

Make sure that you have the Acer Predator software for fan control & latest BIOS updates too.

It will really help us if you could share some screenshots or temperature numbers using HWinfo software or other equivalent.

To check which GPU your software is running on,  use the Gforce icon in notification area. Also you can use

Nvidia Control panel-> Manage 3D settings ->Program settings and select the program to customize."
fd3vki,"Has she tried using the PredatorSense app to monitor the temperature? If you go to the Monitoring tab it will start a running account of both the temps of the gpu and cpu and you can see exactly how hot it gets or if it spikes.

You probably want to try this both when playing with it unplugged as well as plugged up so you can get some kind of baseline idea, and also look at what temps it is idling at. I've got a very similar laptop (same specs except came with 256 hard drive and I did some upgrades on it).

Also, just putting this out there, but if it games completely fine when not plugged in, then maybe the problem is software related rather than hardware? I'd definitely try a factory reset before thermal paste (you can back games from steam up onto an external drive if you don't want to have to redownload).

And just one more thing: How long ago did she get the laptop? If it is within a month of purchase she still can get a warranty put on it, and I think there is by default a manufacturers warranty of 1 year for 2019 and up predators (2 years before that).

However from what I've read doing a repaste yourself voids that warranty (although you can do other modifications without voiding the warranty so long as you don't damage anything while doing them and remove them before shipping your system in).

Also, just putting this out there, but probably about 4 months after I got my predator I had some weird issue where my laptop was staying too warm for like a week (instead of idling between 35-47 Celsius like normal it was idling in the high 60's to high 70's, and when gaming it would be maxed out on like bioshock 1 during just moving around). I was just about to break down and reopen it up but the problem pretty much resolved on its own so I'm not sure if it was a software thing that got worked out or maybe there was a slight fan obstruction that cleared itself. It has pretty much been completely fine for the last several months."
fd3vki,"Don't even think about trying to repaste your computer when you lack the expertise to do it properly with a high-quality thermal paste or carbon pad.  The risk is too high for potentially causing more damage during disassembly of the computer.

The most common heat problem is from tinkering with the settings in an attempt to overclock the system without enough knowledge about computers in general.  If anyone has been ""adjusting"" the performance settings, reset everything to defaults.

The second most common tends to be related to tinkering with the video card settings to force the NVIDIA card to always act as primary. This has the high-end GPU working harder all the time instead of the moments when it is really needed.  Let the Intel onboard GPU handle the mundane tasks and keep the power draw & heat to a minimum.

The third most common issue is the CPU voltage running as if the computer is needed for high-end tasks. Modest undervolting has been extremely successful for a large number of reddit members.

Other heat related issues have been simple things like not setting the laptop on a firm surface (i.e. not nestled snuggly in a blanket on your bed or sofa) or other items blocking the air vents."

Disable the PXE settings since you obviously don't boot to a corporate network, that is why it isn't finding a PXE boot device. After that, you'll be able to find out if the hard drive is failing. The drive might be bad which forces the BIOS to try a network device.  

Hopefully you (or your brother) followed the instructions for creating the system recovery media after receiving dozens of warnings to create the media when you first received the computer.

I had to put extra effort into searching for that model in the EU market. 

While some sites claim you can install a 16GB stick of RAM. Acer officially states that you can install up to an 8GB stick of ram.   

If that model has a 1TB HDD and a 16GB Optane SSD, you can replace the Optane M.2 SSD with a M.2 2280 NVMe SSD.  Then, you can use the NVMe as your Windows boot drive to make the computer a lot faster."

Did you open the case to confirm it has an open RAM slot?  If it has 4GB soldered and an open RAM slot, you should be able to install a 16GB stick of RAM. Depending on which Swift model you have, you may not be able to upgrade the RAM. 

 Without more details I can only scan through the U.S. distribution models.  

I found the Model: SF314-56-58Q5  Part Number: NX.H4CAA.006 which ships with 4GB or 8GB without the ability to upgrade RAM.  There are variations of the SF314-56 that ship to the EU and Indonesia regions."

If you return it to get another one, you might end up with a worse one that the one you have now.   A dead pixel is disappointing but, all manufacturer's have a rather specific dead pixel policy.  Be thankful it isn't in the middle of the screen.

dkd5nw,had mine about the same length of time and the only issue i had was replacing the 500GB HDD(agaming laptop with under a 2TB of storage is a damn joke) for 2TB was a bitch...the Bios really hates MBR'S(Master Boot Records)
dkd5nw,"When you registered the computer with Acer support, how much time was left in the warranty period?

That is your first official indication if the computer might have been returned by a previous owner or if it was tagged by Acer as a refurb or returned computer.

We've seen a lot of posts about the Nitro 5 [https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Acer%20Nitro%205](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Acer%20Nitro%205)"
dkd5nw,"I have the same problem (Issue #3) with my Acer Aspire 5 A515-43-R057 just now when I put in 32GB of compatible Crucial RAM and a 1TB Samsung 960 EVO SSD. My M.2 SSD that came with it stays in and keeps the operating system.

Upgrade was super easy. Took me 20min. Watched official video from Acer on YouTube.

I reconnect battery and boot. I first check the BIOS: Everything got detected correctly.

I boot Manjaro. Everything fine. I format the new SSD

I shutdown and put the bottom case on properly again and screw screws back in.

I reboot: No bootable device found. My body shivers hot and cold and my pulse goes to 200.

I reset the BIOS many times by pressing powee button for 2 minutes: Nothing.

I disconnect the SSD again. Nothing.

I boot a linux live stick. Hard drived do not show.

I find out Manjaro Live USB lets me detect other bootloaders. It finds my M.2 SSD's grub efi. How if the BIOS cannot find the drives? WTF????

My operating system boots flawlessly. All drives are detected and readable and writeable.

I can now only boot my OS from a USB Manjaro Stick. I can never install another OS again?

Does anyone have any news on this bug?"

I don't understand what you tried to tell us in that sentence."
d5uls4,"You can't add one. There isn't a place to put it. However you could clone it to an external drive in an USB enclosure. Since it sounds like you have no backups, this might be the best thing.

Don't know what size drive you have now, but you should be able to put a 500gb SATA ssd in it. You may have to update bios.

If you are unsure on doing this, take to a local computer shop and have them do it.

d5uls4,"Welcome to REDDIT!

Many of the answers and additional information can always be obtained from the support page for your computer. You would have been redirected to that page when you registered your computer for the warranty.  
[https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/support-product/5344?b=1&pn=NX.MPSEK.007&sn=43103045834](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/support-product/5344?b=1&pn=NX.MPSEK.007&sn=43103045834)

You probably already found the general data sheet:   
[https://www.acer.com/datasheets/2014/4876/E5-571/NX.MPSEK.007.html](https://www.acer.com/datasheets/2014/4876/E5-571/NX.MPSEK.007.html)

Always look up the part number of RAM currently installed in your computer (open the case & look at it) to make sure you get the correct specs. Your E5 laptop will use 16GB max of DDR3 PC3-12800   
\-BUT-   
It specifically needs low voltage so-dimms labeled DDR3L-1600.  
Many people ignore that ""L"" which indicates low voltage and they find out the hard way that higher voltage RAM will not work at all in their computer.

You definitely want to splurge & add more RAM. Another 4GB stick of RAM will help with day-to-day regular work. If you are debating the 16GB upgrade, it really depends on how you use your computer most people are surprised that they don't need to strain their budget and max out on RAM because they don't really stress their computer enough to make use of it.     Yeah, I'll admit, I maxxed mine to 32GB just because I could and not because 20% of my work actually needs it.  

If  your budget can stretch a bit, consider getting an SSD drive for your primary boot drive and then move your current drive to the CD-Rom caddy.  You can easily clone the current drive to the new SSD with the free version of Macrium.   That one change will give you a definite performance boost for that particular laptop and add a couple more years of life to it.  The ADATA Su800 is a fast, economical 1TB SSD. It performs very close to Samsung, Intel and Crucial at half the cost. It is frequently on sale at Amazon for under $100.  Remember that with all SSDs, the larger the capacity, the better performance you'll get.  

  
Those CD-Rom replacement HDD caddies are pretty darn cool. I've used them on  a couple ASUS laptops and they worked great. Adding more storage is a much better use of that CD-Rom bay.  
You do want to update the BIOS for any problem corrections for your system and to resolve SSD related issues. Most driver updates should be delivered by Windows Updates but it never hurts to check them too.  
Before you start all this, make sure you get at least a 16GB usb drive to create the system recovery media. Your computer didn't come with any install disks and every year Acer reduces the number of recovery disks that are available for purchase."

cqbki8,"It helps to tell us the specs of your computer instead of just referring to the generic spec sheet with the ""suggested"" retail configuration.

The link you gave us to the  AN515-52-53H0 shows it has NVMe and SATA connectors so I'm confused as to why you say the option to add storage is not available. If you really wanted to use a disc drive instead of SSD, you can simply install the cheaper, older, slower storage. Your model might be missing the SATA cable. You can order it from Acer.

RAM won't be much of an issue since you can upgrade it to 32GB."
cqbki8,"You might have the same series but depending on the country of origin, date of manufacturing and actual model number, I doubt you'll ever find a YouTube video for the exact same laptop.

The 2.5"" drive \_IS\_ the second drive.  You would install a m.2 SSD as the (boot) primary and use the 2.5"" SATA for additional data.     
The latest Nitro laptops have 2 m.2 PCIe ports.

My view is that Optane boost, while great to improve platter drive performance, is a waste of a PCIe port, unless you don't have the budget to upgrade.  <rant>Why use a small Optane SSD to cache a copy of Windows when you can run your entire installation from the m.2 SSD and get even better performance?</rant>   At least you ended up with the good Optane SSD. The performance of that 32GB is far superior to the 16GB so don't trash it.

I have an ACER Aspire 5 A515-52-526C (i5-8265U quad core). It had a 256GB SATA m.2 in the PCIe port. I replaced it with a 1TB PCIe, upgraded 8GB to 32GB RAM, added a 1TB SATA SSD and am extremely happy with results. I got lucky since the laptop was on sale with the crappy components."

co9n74,"Yep, that is one of the biggest ignored features on new laptops. The Intel Optane is PCIe NVMe.  

You will have to change the BIOS setting that is currently using the Optane for a cached copy of Windows.  Otherwise it won't even try to boot from the new SSD."
